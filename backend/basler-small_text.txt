is implementing a new voltage regulation by changin g the input voltage and 
implementing a switch. Furthermore the layout was o ptimized. 
 
Reason for Change 
The change was originally made to reduce the power consumption of new high 
resolution and high speed camera models as for exam ple the acA2500-60um/uc.  
As these models and following camera models are sti ll under development, the mass 
production of these models will already start with the new coreboard.

CUSTOMER STORYAOI System with Frame Grabbers and FPGA 
Applet from Silicon Software 
Delvitech from Switzerland offers automatic optical inspection (AOI) to prevent process errors, increase the yield 
and reduce the costs in the manufacturing of assembled printed circuit boards (PCB). The core element of these 
systems is an optical head consisting of five cameras and various side-mounted illuminations. The company recently 
developed a new head upgrade for its AOI systems installed in the market, with more powerful cameras and frame 
grabbers – and is now benefiting of important sales, offering solutions significantly better with higher speed, 
improved detectability and greater flexibility. 
Delvitech needed new cameras for the optical head, as 
the existing ones lagged behind the desired high image 
quality. The cameras had to achieve a higher resolution, 
have suitable interfaces to the new frame grabbers and 
acquire at least 30 frames per second. For the scalability 
of the system, the interchangeability of cameras and 
frame grabbers was an important requirement, indepen -
dent of the camera interface and without changing the 
image processing software developed in-house. 
In the optical head there are a camera at the top and four 
cameras at the side together with 24 xenon light sources, 
4 RGB leds and a special sensor. A monochrome CMOS 
area scan camera 25 Mpixel with CoaXPress interface 
was selected for the upper camera instead of the pre -
vious 4 MP resolution camera. Four monochrome Camera 
Link Basler ace CMOS with 4 MP resolution and 180 
frames per second are now used for the side cameras 
replacing the previous analog ones. The upper camera 
has a larger sensor so that fine features can be better 
resolved or the same level of performance can be main -
tained at a higher throughput. Due to the also larger 
sensors of the side cameras, discrepancies in the resolu -
tion between all cameras are reduced. The selected 
cameras are dimensioned to run below their potential 
performance and therefore allow the performance of the 
system to be enhanced at a later stage. Scalability and Great Flexibility 
The disadvantage of the frame grabbers used so far was 
that they were only suitable for special cameras and were 
incompatible with the new high performance cameras 
selected, the intended light sources and the self-deve -
loped software based on algorithms with artificial intelli -
gence. Therefore Delvitech chose two different program -
mable frame grabbers from Silicon Software, both com -
patible with diverse cameras and lighting as well as the 
software. The upper camera, four side cameras and the 
lighting are synchronized by the microEnable 5 VCX-QP 
CoaXPress frame grabber, while the up to four side 
cameras are triggered by two Camera Link frame grab -
bers microEnable 5 VCL. With the system upgrade, Del -
vitech also switched to the very powerful 64bit D.ONE 
Core. 
The system was designed for scalability with the use of 
one standard camera up to five high-end cameras in the 
highest expansion stage, which the frame grabbers 
support. In order to connect them to the software, the 
project partners jointly developed image acquisition 
functions as a hardware applet using the FPGA develop -
ment environment VisualApplets from Silicon Software 
with the advantage that the frame grabbers, already 
during the image transfer, always generate the same 
output format. This means that the software can be easily 
further used when changing cameras, frame grabbers or 
the camera interface. The applet was designed as a data 
flow model and synthesized as FPGA code for the runtime 
environment on the frame grabber. The overall imple -
mentation of hardware, software and applet was com -
pleted within a few days. “We owe the short development 
time to Silicon Software‘s extraordinary consulting com -
petence and operational readiness. On the basis of only 
two coaching sessions the design-in could be completed 
entirely,” explains Roberto Gatti, VP Sales and Marketing 
of Delvitech.

High-Quality Software Included 
When inspecting assembled printed circuit boards, the 
AOI system on the one hand checks the presence, 
absence, the polarity, the names, the colors, the polari -
ties, and the correct positioning of the components. On 
the other hand, it inspects the shape of the solder joints 
by their form detecting opens, shorts, cold solder joints 
and any type of defects related to wrong solder joints on 
reflow and wave applications. For this purpose, a part of 
the printed circuit board is illuminated according to the 
specifications of the software using RGB led, whereupon 
one or more cameras trigger and take images with color 
reflection. This creates one or more images from different 
angles, whose colors are later reconstructed using the 
Delvitech software. The frame grabbers synchronize the 
triggering of the cameras and the numerous light sources 
via a flash controller. After image acquisition, the images 
are corrected by the software in the course of image pre -
processing, for example their orientation. The AOI image processing system with the optical head is 
used in production plants. Due to the now given higher 
camera resolution, it achieves significantly better measu -
rement results at four times the speed and higher frame 
rate. This means that considerably more examinations of 
printed circuit boards can be carried out per minute – at 
the same cost of the overall system. The system now pro -
cesses images in just half a second, from acquisition and 
image pre-processing to merging and comparing the 
images, analyzing them and outputting the results. “The 
components can be flexibly exchanged and scaled 
regardless of the camera model and interface, and the 
system can be easily adapted to new customer require -
ments thanks to the accompanying applet,” states Gatti. 
In order to meet these requirements in the future, an 
extension of the system to 3D inspection with stereo 
vision is planned, which would further optimize the 
system.

PCN Number :  09/2021  
Title:  Temperature State Feature – 
Removed on certain ace U and ace 
L cameras (part 3)  
Product Family:  ace U and  ace L  with certain sensors  
Release date:  September  06, 2021 
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
The demand -supply -situation for semiconductor -related components has become 
increasingly tense  and it  is our utmost aim to provide our customers  with the most 
reliable and competitive lead times possible in this challenging environment .  
One component that faces a s hortage is a temperatu re sensor that is needed for the 
“Device Temperature  Feature ” and the “Temperature State Feature ”.  
Due to the shortage of the temperature sensor we will focus on delivering cameras 
and reduce the  feature scope . The “Device Temperature F eature ” won’t be of  use 
anymore and the “Temperature State Feature ” will be deactivated for the cameras 
listed below.   
We manage to stay within the UL certifications, but this means the cameras may only 
be operate d with a lens  or any other heat dissipating device . 
Once the demand -supply -situation  has relaxed, we plan to offer both feature s again. 
This will be published in another Product Change Notification.  
 
Affected cameras  (detailed list of models below):  
ace U GigE with the following sensors: Python 2000, Python 5000, IMX174, IMX249, 
IMX273, IMX287, IMX264, ICX618 Replacement  
 
ace U and ace L USB with the following sensors: Python 500, Python 1300, Python 
2000, Python 5000, IMX174, IMX249, IMX250, IMX252, IMX183, IMX304, IMX253, 
IMX267, IMX255, IMX264 color, IMX265 colo r, IMX273 color

Change Description  
 
The following Temperature R equirements  are specified in our Basler Product 
Documentation to operate the cameras listed below.  
Housing Temperature during operation  0-50 °C  
Housing Temperature according to UL  max. 70°C  
Ambient Temperature according to UL  max. 30°C  
UL test conditions : no lens attached to camera; no heat dissipation measures; 
ambient temperature kept at 30°C.  
 
The temperature limits will not change. However, to stay in accordance with UL  the 
test conditions were changed: cameras need to always be equipped with a lens . No 
camera exceeds the UL temperature limit of 70°C and all cameras will keep their UL 
certification.  
Please note that t o avoid burns or damaging the camera you must never use the 
camera without a lens  or alternative heat dissipation  to operate  the camera  
according to the specified maximum housing temperature of 50°C .  
 
 
The Device Temperature  camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the camera  (see Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below , the feature will still be accessible. However, 
because the se cameras will not be equipped with the temperature sensor, a  default  
value of 421°C  will be returned .

The Temperature State  camera feature indicates whether the camera's internal 
temperature is normal or too high.  In case of over temperature , the image acquisition 
is stopped and a  test image appears until the camera has cooled down again  (see 
Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below, the feature will be deactiva ted by removing the 
temperature thresholds. It will always return the parameter value “ok”.   
 
The over temperature threshold is for the following two purposes:  
1) Ensuring UL conformity of the camera .  
This requirement is still fulfilled as described  above.   
 
2) Preventing damage of the camera.   
At elevated temperatures, the camera may get damaged, the camera's lifetime is 
shortened, and image quality can degrade.  We therefore ask you to take special care 
to provide sufficient heat dissipation to maintain the temperat ure of the camera 
housing at 50 °C or less .  
 
If sufficient heat dissipation is provided in the application and cameras are operated 
according to the specified maximum housing temperature of 50°C , this product 
change does not have an impact on heat development within the camera.  
In case cameras in your application have switched to test images before (please see 
“Temperature State Feature” ), your application might exceed the specified operating 
temperature  and additional measures to provide sufficient heat dissipation might be 
needed. Please contact our Basle r Support team for assistance.  
If cameras in your  application haven’t switched  to test images before, the removed 
thresholds will have no  consequence.  
 
Please note that  you won’t be able to update future firmware versions on cameras that 
were produced  without the temperature sensor.

usability or technical performance of the lens.

Title: Simplified licensing model of 
VisualApplets  
Product Family: VisualApplets 
Release date:  November 1st, 2022  
Contact:     Basler Support  
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous     Firmware     PC Software 
 Product design   Process  
 
Reason for Change 
 
To enhance VisualApplets for Basler customers, the VisualApplets licensing model will 
be simplified starting with VisualApplets version 3.3.2.  
 
Change Description 
 
Starting from November 1st 2022, all licenses for previous VisualApplets extensions, 
e.g., VisualApplets 3 Expert License, VisualApplets 3 Debugging License, 
VisualApplets 3 Parameters Translation License, VA3 LIB JPEG Compression 
License, VA3 LIB Segment./Classification License, will be discontinued.  
Instead, these licenses will be automatically included into the VisualApplets IDE 
License. 
The same change also affects all corresponding VisualApplets test licenses, which will 
be included into the VisualApplets IDE (Eval.) License. 
The changes will be effective with VisualApplets version 3.3.2 and will apply to all 
upcoming VisualApplets versions.

Title:  Device Temperature Feature – 
Removed on certain ace U and ace 
L cameras  
Product Family:  ace U and  ace L  with certain sensors  
Release date:  August 16, 2021 
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
The demand -supply -situation for semiconductor -related components has become 
increasingly tense  and it  is our utmost aim to provide our customers  with the most 
reliable and competitive lead times possible in this challenging environment .  
One component that faces a s hortage is a temperature sensor that is needed for the 
Device Temperature camera feature . This feature has never been officially supported 
and listed in our Basler Product Documentation for the cameras listed below. 
However, for the convenience of our customers it was available anyway.     
Due to the shortage of the temperature sensor we will focus on delivering cameras 
and go back to the officially stated feature scope . The Device Temperature camera 
feature won’t be of use  anymore for the cameras listed below.   
Once the demand -supply -situation has relaxed, we plan to offer the feature again. 
This will be published in another Product Change Notification.  
 
Affected cameras (detailed  list of models below):   
 ace L GigE  (IMX267, IMX304)  
 ace U USB (IMX226, IMX178)  
 ace U GigE (IMX226, IMX178)

Change Description  
 
The Device Temperature  camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the camera  (see Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below , the feature will still be accessible. However, 
because the se cameras will not be equipped with the temperature sensor, a  default  
value of 421°C  will be returned .   
 
The related  Temperature State  camera feature indicates whether the camera's 
internal temperature is normal or too high.  In case of over temperature , the image 
acquisition is stopped and a  test image appears until the camera has cooled down 
again.  
As stated in our Basler Product Documentation , the feature has never been supported 
by these cameras.  Nevertheless in pylon Viewer the feature has always shown the 
parameter value  “ok”, this will not change . 
   
This change does not have any impact on heat development within the cameras.

Title:  Firmware  Update For ace 2 
Cameras  
Product Family:  ace 2  
Release date:  June  17, 2020 (PM)  
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
There are two main reasons for this new firmware release:  
1. We fixed a b ug in our ace 2 models which mainly limited the possible speed 
increase for our Compression Beyond feature on ace 2 GigE cameras.  
2. We added a new High Speed Burst Mode, allowing the user to trigger a 
predefined burst of images at the maximum sensor speed possible in our 
hardware.  
 
Change Description  
1. Fixed Bug  
The fixed behavior of our camera now allows the user to achieve a factor two increase 
in speed on ace 2 Pro GigE cameras by using the Compression Beyond feature. The 
accurate increase heavily depends on the working point of the camera (pixel form at, 
ROI, etc.).  
2. New High Speed Burst Mode  
Usually, the frame rate of the camera is not only limited by its sensor and internal 
buffer, but also by its ability to transfer data. This includes, e.g., the interface 
bandwidth or your network setup.  
The High Speed burst mode allows you to work around these data transfer limitations 
and acquire a burst of images as quickly as possible.  PRODUCT CHANGE NOTIFICATION

To achieve this, during a burst, acquiring images and filling the camera's internal 
buffer is highly prioritized over transmitt ing data. Usually, images will be transmitted 
only after all images of a burst have been acquired. This may introduce a delay after 
each burst, i.e., lower the burst rate.

documentation .

Change Description  
Sequencer  
The Sequencer  camera feature  allows you to define sets of parameter settings, called 
sequencer sets, and apply them to a sequence of image acquisitions.  
As the camera acquires images, it applies one sequencer set after the other. This 
enables you to quickly change camera parameters without compromising the 
maximum frame rate.  
For further information about  this feature  please take a look at our product 
documentation  or contact the Basler Support.  
 
Static Defect Pixel Correction  
The Defect Pixel Correction  camera feature  allows you to minimize the influence of 
sensitivity differences of individual pixels of the sensor.  
In acquired images, some pixels may appear significantly brighter or darker than the 
rest, even if uniform light is used. This problem is caused by differences in sensitivity 
of the individual pixels which in turn are due to production tolerances.  
The Static Defect Pixel Correction is based on files that are stored on the camera and 
contain a list of defect pixel coordinates.  
The following defect pixel correction files can be stored on the camera:  
• Factory file: Contains the coordinates of defect pixels that were detected during 
camera production. With this file, the camera corrects pixels that have a 
significantly  lower  intensity value than the neighboring pixels, including 
completely black pixels.  
• User fil e: Contains user -defined coordinates. You can upload this file to the 
camera. This allows you to define new defect pixels that might have occurred  
over time, regardless of whether these pixels are too dark or too bright.  
For further information about this  feature  please take a look at our product 
documentation  or contact the Basler Support.

CUSTOMER STORYMulti-talented: Basler boost with Customized 
Interface Card in a Line Scan Application
Customer
 MJV-Sähkö Oy and Lateral Engine Oy
 Location:  Lahti, Finland and Espoo, Finland
 Industry: Factory Automation
 Implementation: 2019-2020
Application
MJV-Sähkö Oy delivers machine vision systems with 
parameterization capability for the sorting of plywood 
sheets for the plywood industry. In their automation pro -
jects such as veneer grading it is important to work with 
efficient, up-to-date automation systems to achieve high 
productivity. The veneer grading process often uses line 
scan cameras that require a complex installation process. 
This is why MJV-Sähkö Oy was looking for a color area 
scan camera that not only fulfils the requirements for the 
inspection process of the veneer grading, but can also be 
installed easily.Solution and Benefits
In the veneer sheet grading application, the sheets (e.g. 
1800 mm wide) are imaged on a conveyor using high-
resolution line scan imaging. Software analyzes the 
sheets using modern deep-learning techniques and the 
results can be used by the manufacturing system for 
various purposes such as separating the sheets into diffe -
rent grades or splicing the material.
“There is nothing revolutionary in line scan applications 
but the novelty at the core of this Customer Story is how 
we communicated with Basler to implement a Basler area 
scan camera for the imaging”, states Jaakko Rantala from 
Lateral Engine Oy. The basic idea is to configure the 
camera and the interface card so that the camera uses an 
AOI of only a few lines at a very high frame rate (e.g. 4 
lines @ 2000 Hz, triggered by an encoder interface). The 
chunks of grouped lines are then efficiently stitched 
together on the interface card side before transferring 
the complete frames to the host software.
This was made possible by following:
 High-resolution CMOS sensor of the Basler boost 
camera
 High bandwidth achieved by the CoaXPress 2.0 
interface (Basler boost camera + Basler CXP-12

Title:  Temperature State Feature – 
Removed on certain ace U and ace 
L cameras  
Product Family:  ace U and  ace L  with certain sensors  
Release date:  August 23, 2021 
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
The demand -supply -situation for semiconductor -related components has become 
increasingly tense  and it  is our utmost aim to provide our customers  with the most 
reliable and competitive lead times possible in this challenging environment .  
One component that faces a s hortage is a temperature sensor that is needed for the 
“Device Temperature  Feature ” and the “Temperature State Feature ”.  
Due to the shortage of the temperature sensor we will focus on delivering cameras 
and reduce the  feature scope . The “Device Temperature F eature ” won’t be of use  
anymore and the “Temperature State Feature ” will be deactivated for the cameras 
listed below.   
Once the demand -supply -situation  has relaxed, we plan to offer both feature s again. 
This will be published in another Product Change Notification.  
 
Affected cameras  (detailed list of models below):  
 
 ace U GigE with IMX183, IMX265, Python  300, Python 500 and Python  1300 
Sensor   
 ace U USB with IMX273 mono, IMX265 mono, IMX264 m ono, IMX287 and 
Python  300 Sensor  
 
Depending on the  stock situation we might expand this measure to further cameras 
models soon.

We share this  initial version of the Product Change Notification by email once and 
publish updates  later on our Website. Therefore please closely monitor th is Product 
Change Notification on our Website . All recent updates are marked in red.  
 
Change Description  
 
The following Temperature R equirements  are specified in our Basler Product 
Documentation to operate the cameras listed below. These Requirements are still 
valid and will not change.  
Housing Temperature during operation  0-50 °C  
Housing Temperature according to UL 60950 -1 max. 70°C  
Ambient Temperature according to UL 60950 -1 max. 30°C  
UL 60950 -1 test conditions: no lens attached to camera; no heat dissipation 
measures; ambient temperature kept at 30°C.  
 
The Device Temperature  camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the camera  (see Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below , the feature will  still be accessible. However, 
because the se cameras will not be equipped with the temperature sensor, a  default  
value of 421°C  will be returned .   
 
The Temperature State  camera feature indicates whether the camera's internal 
temperature is normal or too high.  In case of over temperature , the image acquisition 
is stopped and a  test image appears until the camera has cooled down again  (see 
Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below, the feature will be deactivated by removing the 
temperature thresholds. It will always return the parameter value “ok”.

The over temperature threshold used to serve two purposes:  
1) Ensuring UL conformity of the camera .  
This requirement is still fulfilled. The threshold is only removed from models that do 
not exceed the maximum 70°C Housing Temperature according to UL 60950 -1.  
 
2) Preventing damage of the camera.   
At elevated temperatures, the camera may get damaged, the camera's lifetime is 
shortened, and image quality can degrade.  We therefore ask you to take special care 
to provide sufficient heat dissipation to maintain the temperat ure of the camera 
housing at 50 °C or less .  
 
If sufficient heat dissipation is provided in the application and cameras are operated 
according to the specified maximum housing temperature of 50°C , this product 
change does not have an impact on heat development within the camera.  
In case cameras in your application have switched to test images before (please see 
“Temperature State Feature” ), your application might exceed the specified operating 
temperature  and additional measures to provide sufficient heat dissipation might be 
needed. Please contact our Basle r Support team for assistance.  
If cameras in your  application haven’t switched  to test images before, the removed 
thresholds will have no  consequence.  
 
Please note that  you won’t be able to update future firmware versions on cameras that 
were produced  without the temperature sensor.

dart models  
Product Family:  dart (all models)  
Release date:  January 15 , 2018  
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
Due to persistent  problems in logistics, inventory management and release 
management caused by single dart orders associated  with loans  and general design 
sample  as well as  custom dart prototype distribution all dart models (dar t USB, dart 
BCON for LVDS) are  now shipped  in single packaged units.  
 
Change Description  
To date , the dart USB as well as the dart BCON for LVDS camera modules have been  
shipped in package units of 5 cameras. Also, the minimum order  quantity for all dart 
models has been  5 pieces . Starting from January 15th 2018   this will change and all 
dart models (dart USB, dart BCON for LVDS) will be shipped to customers in single 
packaged units . In a ddition to that the MOQ is reduced to 1 piece for all models.  
The changeover to individual packaging has no effect on the current list prices of the 
dart family (dart USB, dart BCON for LVDS). Also, w ith changing the  minimum order 
quantity, all customers are no longer obliged to order a multiple of 5 dart cameras.

Change Description 
Vignetting is a well-known phenomenon in image proc essing and describes the 
decrease in image brightness towards the edge. This  often results in this effect: 
           
Fig. 1 Left without Vignetting Correction Feature, R ight with Vignetting Correction Feature 
Our Vignetting Correction feature corrects this eff ect and at the same time there is no 
negative effect on the frame rate or image quality after a one-time calibration of the 
camera, since the correction values are stored in t he camera and automatically taken 
into account in the image output. 
Please note that you have to use pylon 5.2.0 or hig her to use the Vignetting Feature. 
Further details about the feature behavior and the usage can be found on:

 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
We continuously optimize our products and processes. For this reason we decide d to 
optimize our Getting Started Guide.  The Getting Started Guide is a letter where we 
explain  how to get started with a camera . Until today it is  enclosed in every box within  
which  the camera is delivered.   
This change will lead to a better quality of information for our customers by using our 
online product documentation.  Furthermore, we avoid the usage of  unnecessary paper  
which is often discarded . This takes us one step closer to less paper consumption in 
terms of sustainability . 
Change Description  
 
The Getting Started Guide which is enclosed within the box  of each camera  will be 
exchanged by  an universal  product inlay card.

Change Description 
With revision 106202 – 17  the model acA1300-60gmNIR gets a new firmware vers ion.  
 
Reason for Change 
The firmware change was necessary to adapt the sens or behavior especially the 
saturation capacity due to production variation of the sensor manufacturer, but we 
make sure that it is within our camera test specifi cation.  
Due to production variation of the sensor manufactu rer – especially at the production 
of the silicon for sensors – it could came to minim al deviation of sensor behavior. This 
could appear at lower saturation capacity or bloomi ng effect at long exposure times 
and high gain on the other hand. 
Basler optimize this sensor behavior with the new f irmware to deliver the familiar 
quality at its best.

Title:  Basler SLP Controller now up to  
100ms pulse width  
Product Family:  Basler Lighting

Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
To provide our customers the best poss ible images, we continuously listen to the 
feedback of our customers  to improve their machines and applications.  
In particular, customers who use rolling shutter sensors and are already enthusiastic 
about the Basler SLP feature have asked for a longer pulse width of the SLP controlle r. 
Therefore, the Basler SLP Controller will now support a pulse width of 50µs up to 
100ms.  
We are very pleased that the new Basler SLP feature , which drives down the effort to 
integrate lightings in a vision system strongly , has been so well received from our 
customers.  
Further information about this feature can be found on:  
https://www.baslerweb.com/en/products/vision -components/basler -lighting/  
 
Change Description  
Basler SLP is an easy way to add lighting to a vision system.  
The Basler SLP camera feature enables the Basler SLP controller  to be used together 
with the all our popular ace U and ace L cameras . PRODUCT CHANGE NOTIFICATION

The feature enables the direct communication between the Basler SLP Controller and 
the camera, allowing the lighting to be easily operated in different modes such as 
continuous, strobe or overdrive.  
When using the Basler SLP Controller, the user can also b enefit from the compatibility 
with the Basler SLP feature and gain access to the simple lighting concept vi a a uniform 
software interface - Basler pylon Camera Software Suite . 
In addition users are given the freedom to choose from a variety of standard lig ht 
sources or use their own.  The solution is suitable for users with lighting experience who 
have applications with specific lighting requirements.  
Based on customer feedback, we have now extended the pulse width . Before this 
change a pulse width of  50µs up to 5 ms. Now each newly ordered Basler SLP Controller 
will support a pulse width of 50µs up to 100ms .  
We are happy that the Basler SLP Controller is now also the right choice for applications 
that require a longer pulse width.

Title:  Firmware Update on         
acA640 -121gm  
Product Family:  ace U 
Release date:  29.04. 2019  
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
To provide our customers the best possible  replacement camera for the discontinued 
CCD sensor ICX618 , Basler  developed and just recently launched  the acA640 -121gm .  
In some cases users experience d long times for opening the camera. This long 
opening times are caused by the poor performance of olde r GenICam versions in 
caching the more complex GenICam XML Files in current cameras.  
In order to resolve that issue a more recent GenICam version or a new camera 
firmware is required.   
With this firmware release the acA640 -121gm comes along with two different XML 
Files in order to allow the best performance in both cases.  
 
Further information about  Baslers unique 1:1 replacement camera  acA640 -121 can be 
found on:  
https://www.baslerweb.com/en/products/product -highlights/icx618 -replacement/

Change Description  
With this firmware release of FW1.1 -0 the acA640 -121gm comes along with two 
different XML Files.  
Due to the explained intended use as a replacement camera  for older camera models , 
the XML File for an improved behavior with older SDK/GenICam versions is set by 
default.  
If customers want to use the fully equipped feature set (e.g. including USEM, 
Sequencer, PGI, etc.) and are using a new SDK/GenICam version, it is possible to 
switch the XML file.

C23 5MP 16mm and 35mm 
lenses 
Product Family:  Basler Premium Lenses

Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:

 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
We optimized the mechanical design of the C23 5MP lens series to improve the 
adjustability and overall accuracy of the aperture. Due to this optimization the min F -
number  of the C23 5MP 16mm and 35mm lenses had to be changed.  
 
Change Description  
The minimum F-number ha d to be changed from f/1.8 to f/ 2.0. This was necessary 
due to overlapping tolerances. This should not be noticed in most applications and we 
don’t expect any impact on your system.  
Please note that the n aming has  change d too (see list below).

Title:  IR-Cut Filter  change  on  
dedicated  ace U cameras  
Product Family:  ace U

Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
Due to ong oing optimizations and process  improvements we changed the IR cut f ilter 
and der f ilter holder (also know n as “passepartout ”) for dedicated  ace U models.  
Change Description  
 
Effected models:  
- ace U with Python  300, Python  500 and Python1300 Sensors 
- ace U with IMX252 and IMX265 Sensors  
Please see detailed list with a ffected camera models below.  
The following pictures show a n IMX265 Sensor, where the difference is visible. The 
passepartout appears  a little bit smaller than the old one  and reduces diffused light. 
The specification  of the IR- Cut filter and their transmission did not change.

 Alitheon, Inc. 
 Location: Bellevue, Washington, USA
 Industry: Factory Automation / Industrial Software
 Implementation: 2020
Application
Each year, global manufacturers and their suppliers 
deliver increasingly sophisticated products to their  
customers. Advanced vehicles, electronics, and other 
engineered goods now reach their markets through a 
precise physical and digital orchestration, with every 
component playing a role for quality and performance. 
Products such as, fasteners, circuit boards, castings, and 
even textiles must now be “smart” – uniquely identified 
and individually traceable. Yet these high-volume parts 
often resist identification, their design incompatible with 
barcode labels, etchings, or packaging. Alitheon was 
founded to solve this problem with a universal traceabi -
lity model, providing item-level certainty without altering 
product designs or manufacturing processes. With just a 
camera in the factory or in the field, Alitheon technology 
verifies the identity of virtually any object using software 
algorithms.
Through contactless machine vision, Alitheon software 
analyses the surface of every unique product or part, 
generating a digital code that differentiates it from even 
millions of seemingly identical objects. This FeaturePrint™ 
ID represents an authoritative, virtual serial number that 
can be stored, checked, and rechecked over an object’s 
entire useful life. In factory settings, FeaturePrint soft -
ware retrofits existing production lines through conti -
nuous-duty industrial cameras. With automated optics 
and sensors in place, even decades-old factory sites can 
easily receive an all-new digital control system to track 
goods. FeaturePrint endpoints can be attached to 
machine cells or operator stations, verifying the  
production flow, and generating data for the enterprise. 
Once a FeaturePrint ID is captured, it is available via cloud 
systems to allow goods to be verified anywhere – in 
plants, distribution channels, or with end users using a mobile app. In order to allow clear identification, Alitheon 
searched for a camera with the ability to capture even the 
smallest details and often during fast moving production 
lines.
Solution and Benefits 
Alitheon specifies Basler products through its Feature -
Print Automate and Feature Print Station components. 
Deployed within a machine retrofit chassis or a benchtop 
form factor, Basler ace L and Classic cameras generate 
images that keep up with production lines. In an automo -
tive setting, a powertrain part may transform through 
automated stages including raw stock, machining, heat 
treating, and grinding. In this case, a Basler camera ope -
rates at each of these four steps, triggering Alitheon’s 
FeaturePrint processing and ensuring continuous quality 
control. Or, in a contract electronics manufacturing 
scenario, a team of skilled operators may utilize multiple 
camera stations powered by Basler cameras and Alitheon 
technology to guide the correct assembly of circuit 
boards and modules. Later, in field service or aftermarket 
settings, the FeaturePrint ID originally generated onsite is 
available for product verification within a mobile app.

Reason for Change  
Due to the fact that our standa rd cables did not fit with our  previous  Basler GigE 
Interface C ard, 4 port, a new card was added to the portfolio instead.  The ports of the 
old card were too close together, which is why the cables did not fit.

Title:  SLP Feature for  
several ace models  
Product Family:  ace U / ace  L 
Release date:  14 August, 2019  
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
To provide our customers the best poss ible images, we always think about new 
features that help customers to improve their machines and applications.  
The most recent feature of this extension is Basler SLP, which drives down  the effort 
to integrate lightings in a vision system strongly.  
Further information about this feature can be found on:  
https://www.baslerweb.com/en/products/vision -components/basler -lighting/  
 
Change Description  
Basler SLP is an easy way to add lighting to a vision system.  
This first Basler SLP release enables the Basler SLP controller  to be used together 
with the supported camera models listed below.  
The feature enables the direct communication between the Basler SLP Controller and

Title:  Device Temperature Feature 
available again  on ace U and

Product Family:  ace U, ace L  
Release date:  February  22, 2022

 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
 
Due to  the tense  demand -supply -situation we decided to remove  a temperature 
sensor which faced a shortage from our ace U and ace L cameras  in Q3/2021 . We 
focused on delivering cameras and reduced the feature scope.  
The Device Temperature Feature  was of no use and the Temperature State 
Feature  was deactivated.  
 
For further information please  see the published PCN’s from our website:   
Device Temperature Feature removed Part 1  
Device Temperature Feature removed Part 2  
Device Temperature Feature removed Part 3  
 
Now the temperature sensor is available again and we  change all cameras listed 
in the above mentioned PCNs back  to the original feature scope.

The Device Temperature camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the cameras (see Basler Product Documentation ). The feature will 
return a correct value agai n and no longer the default value of 421°C.  
 
The Temperature State  camera feature  (see Basler Product Documentation ) 
indicates whether the cameras internal temperature is normal or too high.  In case of 
over temperature, the image acquisition is stopped and a test image appears until the 
camera has cooled down again.  This feature will be activated again and work as 
before .   
Firmware updates are not possible for cameras which were  produced without 
temperature sensor. With this product change a firmware update to future firmware 
versions will be possible again.

Title:  Barcode Change on Product 
Packages  
Product Family:  Basler cameras

Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
We as Basler see the traceability of our cameras as very important and equip our 
cameras  with a serial number on the camera itself and on the product outer package.  
The label on the camera outer  package lists the serial number in a barcode which is 
design ed and used especially for internal automated processes. Due to important 
internal system adaptions Basler needs to change the conte nt of the serial number 
barcode  shortly.  The following example shows a product package label with the 
affected barcode marke d red:  
  
We as Basler know about the importance of such an information and can imagine  that 
you as our customer process this information inside  your system as well.  Therefore, 
we would like to inform you herewith about this change and advise you to familiarize 
your scanning system with the new content . The change will take place s hort term 
beginning calendar week  3 in January 2023.

Title: New Firmware Features on ace 2

Release date:  February 2022  
Contact:     Basler Support 
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous     Firmware     PC Software 
 Product design   Process  
 
Reason for Change 
To offer an even higher value to our customers, new features were added to the ace 2 
firmware and power consumption has been reduced. Furthermore, the new firmware 
delivers maintenance work and corrects deviating camera behaviors. 
 
Change Description 
 
Basler has added valuable features to the ace 2 family which are available on all 
interfaces. 
For your convenience, the Device Link Speed  as well as the Effective Exposure 
Time might now be read out. Additionally, the Sensor State  of the camera can be 
configurated by choosing the values On, Off or Standby . With the camera feature 
Exposure Start Delay  you can determine the period of time between the detection of 
the trigger signal and the actual start of the exposure. 
Furthermore, the power consumption of all ace 2 cameras has been reduced. 
 
Features for selected models 
By activating the  Window Cropping Mode on Rolling Shutter Sensors IMX334 and 
IMX334ROI models the ace 2 camera allows higher framerates when the Region of 
Interest has been reduced. 
For all ace 2 Pro USB models it is now possible to read out the selected Power 
Source. 
We also included some maintenance work and fixed bugs. PRODUCT CHANGE NOTIFICATION

 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
The CoaXPress Premium Cables are subject of a mechanical design change. Reason 
are improvements of the longterm Basler supply chain from manufacturer to our 
customers with the focus on quality , stability and supply reliability . 
The compatibility of the cables with our CoaXPress cameras remain s the same.  
 
Change Description  
The main changes are:  
- the connector changes   
- the raw cable becomes thinner . Due to this, the minimum bending radius of the 
new cable design improves significantly.  
Currently, only the 3m and 5m version receive a design change. Longterm, also the 
10m Basler Premium CoaXPress Cable ( 2200000321 ) is expected to switch to  the 
new design. This will be published in a separate PCN.

Title:  New material codes for dart BCON for 
LVDS models / Development Kits  
Product Family:  dart BCON for LVDS, Development Kits  
Release date:  January 25 , 2018  
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:

 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
 
Basler ’s embedded port folio exists  of camera modules and accompanying 
development kits. Up to  date the development kits have fallen under the product 
category  PowerPack s. In preparation for future portfolio extension s a new pr oduct 
category “Development Kits ” has now been created . As a consequence, the product 
type of the current development kits has changed accordingly.  
The dart BCON for LVDS is Basler’s first camera module with a low -level embedded 
interfac e. BCON is Basler’s proprietary interface technology for embedded systems. In 
preparation for future portfolio extensions based on BCON technology the material 
codes for all dart BCON for LVDS models have changed.  
 
Change Description  
 
In Basler’s material  codes the second last letter describes which interface the camera 
or camera module provides.   
Example:  daA1280 -54bm  
For all dart BCON for LVDS models this letter has now changed from b (BCON)  to l 
(LVDS).   
Example:  daA1280 -54lm  
Please find below a list of all dart BCON for LVDS models with new material codes.

Change Description 
In the design of the camera’s coreboard some improv ements were made. One change 
is implementing a new voltage regulation by changin g the input voltage and 
implementing a switch. Furthermore the layout was o ptimized. 
 
Reason for Change 
The change was originally made to reduce the power consumption of new high 
resolution and high speed camera models as for exam ple the acA2500-60um/uc.  
As these models and following camera models are sti ll under development, the mass 
production of these models will already start with the new coreboard.

 For the cameras listed in this Product Change Notif ication the new coreboard was 
implemented as well to benefit from the stated impr ovements.  
The exact power reduction is depending on your appl ication and setup of the camera 
as well as other conditions as ambient temperature etc. In the following table you see 
one exemplary measurement that was done with an acA 1920-155uc with the full AOI.

CUSTOMER STORYAOI System with Frame Grabbers and FPGA 
Applet from Silicon Software 
Delvitech from Switzerland offers automatic optical inspection (AOI) to prevent process errors, increase the yield 
and reduce the costs in the manufacturing of assembled printed circuit boards (PCB). The core element of these 
systems is an optical head consisting of five cameras and various side-mounted illuminations. The company recently 
developed a new head upgrade for its AOI systems installed in the market, with more powerful cameras and frame 
grabbers – and is now benefiting of important sales, offering solutions significantly better with higher speed, 
improved detectability and greater flexibility. 
Delvitech needed new cameras for the optical head, as 
the existing ones lagged behind the desired high image 
quality. The cameras had to achieve a higher resolution, 
have suitable interfaces to the new frame grabbers and 
acquire at least 30 frames per second. For the scalability 
of the system, the interchangeability of cameras and 
frame grabbers was an important requirement, indepen -
dent of the camera interface and without changing the 
image processing software developed in-house. 
In the optical head there are a camera at the top and four 
cameras at the side together with 24 xenon light sources, 
4 RGB leds and a special sensor. A monochrome CMOS 
area scan camera 25 Mpixel with CoaXPress interface 
was selected for the upper camera instead of the pre -
vious 4 MP resolution camera. Four monochrome Camera 
Link Basler ace CMOS with 4 MP resolution and 180 
frames per second are now used for the side cameras 
replacing the previous analog ones. The upper camera 
has a larger sensor so that fine features can be better 
resolved or the same level of performance can be main -
tained at a higher throughput. Due to the also larger 
sensors of the side cameras, discrepancies in the resolu -
tion between all cameras are reduced. The selected 
cameras are dimensioned to run below their potential 
performance and therefore allow the performance of the 
system to be enhanced at a later stage. Scalability and Great Flexibility 
The disadvantage of the frame grabbers used so far was 
that they were only suitable for special cameras and were 
incompatible with the new high performance cameras 
selected, the intended light sources and the self-deve -
loped software based on algorithms with artificial intelli -
gence. Therefore Delvitech chose two different program -
mable frame grabbers from Silicon Software, both com -
patible with diverse cameras and lighting as well as the 
software. The upper camera, four side cameras and the 
lighting are synchronized by the microEnable 5 VCX-QP 
CoaXPress frame grabber, while the up to four side 
cameras are triggered by two Camera Link frame grab -
bers microEnable 5 VCL. With the system upgrade, Del -
vitech also switched to the very powerful 64bit D.ONE 
Core. 
The system was designed for scalability with the use of 
one standard camera up to five high-end cameras in the 
highest expansion stage, which the frame grabbers 
support. In order to connect them to the software, the 
project partners jointly developed image acquisition 
functions as a hardware applet using the FPGA develop -
ment environment VisualApplets from Silicon Software 
with the advantage that the frame grabbers, already 
during the image transfer, always generate the same 
output format. This means that the software can be easily 
further used when changing cameras, frame grabbers or 
the camera interface. The applet was designed as a data 
flow model and synthesized as FPGA code for the runtime 
environment on the frame grabber. The overall imple -
mentation of hardware, software and applet was com -
pleted within a few days. “We owe the short development 
time to Silicon Software‘s extraordinary consulting com -
petence and operational readiness. On the basis of only 
two coaching sessions the design-in could be completed 
entirely,” explains Roberto Gatti, VP Sales and Marketing 
of Delvitech.

High-Quality Software Included 
When inspecting assembled printed circuit boards, the 
AOI system on the one hand checks the presence, 
absence, the polarity, the names, the colors, the polari -
ties, and the correct positioning of the components. On 
the other hand, it inspects the shape of the solder joints 
by their form detecting opens, shorts, cold solder joints 
and any type of defects related to wrong solder joints on 
reflow and wave applications. For this purpose, a part of 
the printed circuit board is illuminated according to the 
specifications of the software using RGB led, whereupon 
one or more cameras trigger and take images with color 
reflection. This creates one or more images from different 
angles, whose colors are later reconstructed using the 
Delvitech software. The frame grabbers synchronize the 
triggering of the cameras and the numerous light sources 
via a flash controller. After image acquisition, the images 
are corrected by the software in the course of image pre -
processing, for example their orientation. The AOI image processing system with the optical head is 
used in production plants. Due to the now given higher 
camera resolution, it achieves significantly better measu -
rement results at four times the speed and higher frame 
rate. This means that considerably more examinations of 
printed circuit boards can be carried out per minute – at 
the same cost of the overall system. The system now pro -
cesses images in just half a second, from acquisition and 
image pre-processing to merging and comparing the 
images, analyzing them and outputting the results. “The 
components can be flexibly exchanged and scaled 
regardless of the camera model and interface, and the 
system can be easily adapted to new customer require -
ments thanks to the accompanying applet,” states Gatti. 
In order to meet these requirements in the future, an 
extension of the system to 3D inspection with stereo 
vision is planned, which would further optimize the 
system.

Title:  Temperature State Feature – 
Removed on certain ace U and ace 
L cameras (part 3)  
Product Family:  ace U and  ace L  with certain sensors  
Release date:  September  06, 2021 
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
The demand -supply -situation for semiconductor -related components has become 
increasingly tense  and it  is our utmost aim to provide our customers  with the most 
reliable and competitive lead times possible in this challenging environment .  
One component that faces a s hortage is a temperatu re sensor that is needed for the 
“Device Temperature  Feature ” and the “Temperature State Feature ”.  
Due to the shortage of the temperature sensor we will focus on delivering cameras 
and reduce the  feature scope . The “Device Temperature F eature ” won’t be of  use 
anymore and the “Temperature State Feature ” will be deactivated for the cameras 
listed below.   
We manage to stay within the UL certifications, but this means the cameras may only 
be operate d with a lens  or any other heat dissipating device . 
Once the demand -supply -situation  has relaxed, we plan to offer both feature s again. 
This will be published in another Product Change Notification.  
 
Affected cameras  (detailed list of models below):  
ace U GigE with the following sensors: Python 2000, Python 5000, IMX174, IMX249, 
IMX273, IMX287, IMX264, ICX618 Replacement  
 
ace U and ace L USB with the following sensors: Python 500, Python 1300, Python 
2000, Python 5000, IMX174, IMX249, IMX250, IMX252, IMX183, IMX304, IMX253,

Change Description  
 
The following Temperature R equirements  are specified in our Basler Product 
Documentation to operate the cameras listed below.  
Housing Temperature during operation  0-50 °C  
Housing Temperature according to UL  max. 70°C  
Ambient Temperature according to UL  max. 30°C  
UL test conditions : no lens attached to camera; no heat dissipation measures; 
ambient temperature kept at 30°C.  
 
The temperature limits will not change. However, to stay in accordance with UL  the 
test conditions were changed: cameras need to always be equipped with a lens . No 
camera exceeds the UL temperature limit of 70°C and all cameras will keep their UL 
certification.  
Please note that t o avoid burns or damaging the camera you must never use the 
camera without a lens  or alternative heat dissipation  to operate  the camera  
according to the specified maximum housing temperature of 50°C .  
 
 
The Device Temperature  camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the camera  (see Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below , the feature will still be accessible. However, 
because the se cameras will not be equipped with the temperature sensor, a  default  
value of 421°C  will be returned .

The Temperature State  camera feature indicates whether the camera's internal 
temperature is normal or too high.  In case of over temperature , the image acquisition 
is stopped and a  test image appears until the camera has cooled down again  (see 
Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below, the feature will be deactiva ted by removing the 
temperature thresholds. It will always return the parameter value “ok”.   
 
The over temperature threshold is for the following two purposes:  
1) Ensuring UL conformity of the camera .  
This requirement is still fulfilled as described  above.   
 
2) Preventing damage of the camera.   
At elevated temperatures, the camera may get damaged, the camera's lifetime is 
shortened, and image quality can degrade.  We therefore ask you to take special care 
to provide sufficient heat dissipation to maintain the temperat ure of the camera 
housing at 50 °C or less .  
 
If sufficient heat dissipation is provided in the application and cameras are operated 
according to the specified maximum housing temperature of 50°C , this product 
change does not have an impact on heat development within the camera.  
In case cameras in your application have switched to test images before (please see 
“Temperature State Feature” ), your application might exceed the specified operating 
temperature  and additional measures to provide sufficient heat dissipation might be 
needed. Please contact our Basle r Support team for assistance.  
If cameras in your  application haven’t switched  to test images before, the removed 
thresholds will have no  consequence.  
 
Please note that  you won’t be able to update future firmware versions on cameras that 
were produced  without the temperature sensor.

Reason for Change  
In order to serve  the high demand on our C23 5MP Premium Lens series we decided 
to accept slightly different mechanical parts on the outside of the lens. The 
appearance slightly differs, but this difference does not lead to any change in the 
usability or technical performance of the lens.  
Change Description  
 
The following picture shows the differences that can occur on this Lens s eries.  
Please be informed that both product designs can be delivered.  
 
 
- the silver ring is matt or shiny  
 
 
- the riffles of the adjustment rings are 
flat or deep

Title: Simplified licensing model of 
VisualApplets  
Product Family: VisualApplets 
Release date:  November 1st, 2022  
Contact:     Basler Support  
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous     Firmware     PC Software 
 Product design   Process  
 
Reason for Change 
 
To enhance VisualApplets for Basler customers, the VisualApplets licensing model will 
be simplified starting with VisualApplets version 3.3.2.  
 
Change Description 
 
Starting from November 1st 2022, all licenses for previous VisualApplets extensions, 
e.g., VisualApplets 3 Expert License, VisualApplets 3 Debugging License, 
VisualApplets 3 Parameters Translation License, VA3 LIB JPEG Compression 
License, VA3 LIB Segment./Classification License, will be discontinued.  
Instead, these licenses will be automatically included into the VisualApplets IDE 
License. 
The same change also affects all corresponding VisualApplets test licenses, which will 
be included into the VisualApplets IDE (Eval.) License. 
The changes will be effective with VisualApplets version 3.3.2 and will apply to all 
upcoming VisualApplets versions.

Customers with a VisualApplets 3 IDE License valid for VisualApplets versions before 
3.3.2 have to purchase the new VisualApplets IDE License to benefit from the 
simplified licensing introduced with VisualApplets 3.3.2 and to be able to use 
upcoming VisualApplets versions, e.g., VisualApplets 4.x.

Title:  Device Temperature Feature – 
Removed on certain ace U and ace 
L cameras  
Product Family:  ace U and  ace L  with certain sensors  
Release date:  August 16, 2021 
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
The demand -supply -situation for semiconductor -related components has become 
increasingly tense  and it  is our utmost aim to provide our customers  with the most 
reliable and competitive lead times possible in this challenging environment .  
One component that faces a s hortage is a temperature sensor that is needed for the 
Device Temperature camera feature . This feature has never been officially supported 
and listed in our Basler Product Documentation for the cameras listed below. 
However, for the convenience of our customers it was available anyway.     
Due to the shortage of the temperature sensor we will focus on delivering cameras 
and go back to the officially stated feature scope . The Device Temperature camera 
feature won’t be of use  anymore for the cameras listed below.   
Once the demand -supply -situation has relaxed, we plan to offer the feature again. 
This will be published in another Product Change Notification.  
 
Affected cameras (detailed  list of models below):   
 ace L GigE  (IMX267, IMX304)  
 ace U USB (IMX226, IMX178)  
 ace U GigE (IMX226, IMX178)

Change Description  
 
The Device Temperature  camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the camera  (see Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below , the feature will still be accessible. However, 
because the se cameras will not be equipped with the temperature sensor, a  default  
value of 421°C  will be returned .   
 
The related  Temperature State  camera feature indicates whether the camera's 
internal temperature is normal or too high.  In case of over temperature , the image 
acquisition is stopped and a  test image appears until the camera has cooled down 
again.  
As stated in our Basler Product Documentation , the feature has never been supported 
by these cameras.  Nevertheless in pylon Viewer the feature has always shown the 
parameter value  “ok”, this will not change . 
   
This change does not have any impact on heat development within the cameras.

PCN Number :  02 2020  
Title:  Firmware  Update For ace 2 
Cameras  
Product Family:  ace 2  
Release date:  June  17, 2020 (PM)  
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
There are two main reasons for this new firmware release:  
1. We fixed a b ug in our ace 2 models which mainly limited the possible speed 
increase for our Compression Beyond feature on ace 2 GigE cameras.  
2. We added a new High Speed Burst Mode, allowing the user to trigger a 
predefined burst of images at the maximum sensor speed possible in our 
hardware.  
 
Change Description  
1. Fixed Bug  
The fixed behavior of our camera now allows the user to achieve a factor two increase 
in speed on ace 2 Pro GigE cameras by using the Compression Beyond feature. The 
accurate increase heavily depends on the working point of the camera (pixel form at, 
ROI, etc.).  
2. New High Speed Burst Mode  
Usually, the frame rate of the camera is not only limited by its sensor and internal 
buffer, but also by its ability to transfer data. This includes, e.g., the interface 
bandwidth or your network setup.  
The High Speed burst mode allows you to work around these data transfer limitations 
and acquire a burst of images as quickly as possible.  PRODUCT CHANGE NOTIFICATION

To achieve this, during a burst, acquiring images and filling the camera's internal 
buffer is highly prioritized over transmitt ing data. Usually, images will be transmitted 
only after all images of a burst have been acquired. This may introduce a delay after 
each burst, i.e., lower the burst rate.

Change Description  
Sequencer  
The Sequencer  camera feature  allows you to define sets of parameter settings, called 
sequencer sets, and apply them to a sequence of image acquisitions.  
As the camera acquires images, it applies one sequencer set after the other. This 
enables you to quickly change camera parameters without compromising the 
maximum frame rate.  
For further information about  this feature  please take a look at our product 
documentation  or contact the Basler Support.  
 
Static Defect Pixel Correction  
The Defect Pixel Correction  camera feature  allows you to minimize the influence of 
sensitivity differences of individual pixels of the sensor.  
In acquired images, some pixels may appear significantly brighter or darker than the 
rest, even if uniform light is used. This problem is caused by differences in sensitivity 
of the individual pixels which in turn are due to production tolerances.  
The Static Defect Pixel Correction is based on files that are stored on the camera and 
contain a list of defect pixel coordinates.  
The following defect pixel correction files can be stored on the camera:  
• Factory file: Contains the coordinates of defect pixels that were detected during 
camera production. With this file, the camera corrects pixels that have a 
significantly  lower  intensity value than the neighboring pixels, including 
completely black pixels.  
• User fil e: Contains user -defined coordinates. You can upload this file to the 
camera. This allows you to define new defect pixels that might have occurred  
over time, regardless of whether these pixels are too dark or too bright.  
For further information about this  feature  please take a look at our product 
documentation  or contact the Basler Support.

CUSTOMER STORYMulti-talented: Basler boost with Customized 
Interface Card in a Line Scan Application
Customer
 MJV-Sähkö Oy and Lateral Engine Oy
 Location:  Lahti, Finland and Espoo, Finland
 Industry: Factory Automation
 Implementation: 2019-2020
Application
MJV-Sähkö Oy delivers machine vision systems with 
parameterization capability for the sorting of plywood 
sheets for the plywood industry. In their automation pro -
jects such as veneer grading it is important to work with 
efficient, up-to-date automation systems to achieve high 
productivity. The veneer grading process often uses line 
scan cameras that require a complex installation process. 
This is why MJV-Sähkö Oy was looking for a color area 
scan camera that not only fulfils the requirements for the 
inspection process of the veneer grading, but can also be 
installed easily.Solution and Benefits
In the veneer sheet grading application, the sheets (e.g. 
1800 mm wide) are imaged on a conveyor using high-
resolution line scan imaging. Software analyzes the 
sheets using modern deep-learning techniques and the 
results can be used by the manufacturing system for 
various purposes such as separating the sheets into diffe -
rent grades or splicing the material.
“There is nothing revolutionary in line scan applications 
but the novelty at the core of this Customer Story is how 
we communicated with Basler to implement a Basler area 
scan camera for the imaging”, states Jaakko Rantala from 
Lateral Engine Oy. The basic idea is to configure the 
camera and the interface card so that the camera uses an 
AOI of only a few lines at a very high frame rate (e.g. 4 
lines @ 2000 Hz, triggered by an encoder interface). The 
chunks of grouped lines are then efficiently stitched 
together on the interface card side before transferring 
the complete frames to the host software.
This was made possible by following:
 High-resolution CMOS sensor of the Basler boost 
camera
 High bandwidth achieved by the CoaXPress 2.0 
interface (Basler boost camera + Basler CXP-12 
interface card)
 Most importantly: the excellent collaboration with 
Basler in which the interface card was upgraded to 
support new features. The features consist of the line 
stitching and an encoder interface for camera 
triggering.

Title:  Temperature State Feature – 
Removed on certain ace U and ace 
L cameras  
Product Family:  ace U and  ace L  with certain sensors  
Release date:  August 23, 2021 
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
The demand -supply -situation for semiconductor -related components has become 
increasingly tense  and it  is our utmost aim to provide our customers  with the most 
reliable and competitive lead times possible in this challenging environment .  
One component that faces a s hortage is a temperature sensor that is needed for the 
“Device Temperature  Feature ” and the “Temperature State Feature ”.  
Due to the shortage of the temperature sensor we will focus on delivering cameras 
and reduce the  feature scope . The “Device Temperature F eature ” won’t be of use  
anymore and the “Temperature State Feature ” will be deactivated for the cameras 
listed below.   
Once the demand -supply -situation  has relaxed, we plan to offer both feature s again. 
This will be published in another Product Change Notification.  
 
Affected cameras  (detailed list of models below):  
 
 ace U GigE with IMX183, IMX265, Python  300, Python 500 and Python  1300 
Sensor   
 ace U USB with IMX273 mono, IMX265 mono, IMX264 m ono, IMX287 and 
Python  300 Sensor  
 
Depending on the  stock situation we might expand this measure to further cameras 
models soon.

We share this  initial version of the Product Change Notification by email once and 
publish updates  later on our Website. Therefore please closely monitor th is Product 
Change Notification on our Website . All recent updates are marked in red.  
 
Change Description  
 
The following Temperature R equirements  are specified in our Basler Product 
Documentation to operate the cameras listed below. These Requirements are still 
valid and will not change.  
Housing Temperature during operation  0-50 °C  
Housing Temperature according to UL 60950 -1 max. 70°C  
Ambient Temperature according to UL 60950 -1 max. 30°C  
UL 60950 -1 test conditions: no lens attached to camera; no heat dissipation 
measures; ambient temperature kept at 30°C.  
 
The Device Temperature  camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the camera  (see Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below , the feature will  still be accessible. However, 
because the se cameras will not be equipped with the temperature sensor, a  default  
value of 421°C  will be returned .   
 
The Temperature State  camera feature indicates whether the camera's internal 
temperature is normal or too high.  In case of over temperature , the image acquisition 
is stopped and a  test image appears until the camera has cooled down again  (see 
Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below, the feature will be deactivated by removing the 
temperature thresholds. It will always return the parameter value “ok”.

The over temperature threshold used to serve two purposes:  
1) Ensuring UL conformity of the camera .  
This requirement is still fulfilled. The threshold is only removed from models that do 
not exceed the maximum 70°C Housing Temperature according to UL 60950 -1.  
 
2) Preventing damage of the camera.   
At elevated temperatures, the camera may get damaged, the camera's lifetime is 
shortened, and image quality can degrade.  We therefore ask you to take special care 
to provide sufficient heat dissipation to maintain the temperat ure of the camera 
housing at 50 °C or less .  
 
If sufficient heat dissipation is provided in the application and cameras are operated 
according to the specified maximum housing temperature of 50°C , this product 
change does not have an impact on heat development within the camera.  
In case cameras in your application have switched to test images before (please see 
“Temperature State Feature” ), your application might exceed the specified operating 
temperature  and additional measures to provide sufficient heat dissipation might be 
needed. Please contact our Basle r Support team for assistance.  
If cameras in your  application haven’t switched  to test images before, the removed 
thresholds will have no  consequence.  
 
Please note that  you won’t be able to update future firmware versions on cameras that 
were produced  without the temperature sensor.

PCN Number :  01/2018 
Title:  Change of packaging and MOQ for all 
dart models  
Product Family:  dart (all models)  
Release date:  January 15 , 2018  
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
Due to persistent  problems in logistics, inventory management and release 
management caused by single dart orders associated  with loans  and general design 
sample  as well as  custom dart prototype distribution all dart models (dar t USB, dart 
BCON for LVDS) are  now shipped  in single packaged units.  
 
Change Description  
To date , the dart USB as well as the dart BCON for LVDS camera modules have been  
shipped in package units of 5 cameras. Also, the minimum order  quantity for all dart 
models has been  5 pieces . Starting from January 15th 2018   this will change and all 
dart models (dart USB, dart BCON for LVDS) will be shipped to customers in single

Reason for Change 
To provide our customers the best possible images, we always think of new features 
that help customers to improve their machines and a pplications. 
The most recent feature of this extension is Vignet ting Correction, which allows a 
correction of edge shadowing when the image circle is too small in relation to the 
sensor size.

Change Description 
Vignetting is a well-known phenomenon in image proc essing and describes the 
decrease in image brightness towards the edge. This  often results in this effect: 
           
Fig. 1 Left without Vignetting Correction Feature, R ight with Vignetting Correction Feature 
Our Vignetting Correction feature corrects this eff ect and at the same time there is no 
negative effect on the frame rate or image quality after a one-time calibration of the 
camera, since the correction values are stored in t he camera and automatically taken 
into account in the image output. 
Please note that you have to use pylon 5.2.0 or hig her to use the Vignetting Feature. 
Further details about the feature behavior and the usage can be found on:

Reason for Change  
We continuously optimize our products and processes. For this reason we decide d to 
optimize our Getting Started Guide.  The Getting Started Guide is a letter where we 
explain  how to get started with a camera . Until today it is  enclosed in every box within  
which  the camera is delivered.   
This change will lead to a better quality of information for our customers by using our 
online product documentation.  Furthermore, we avoid the usage of  unnecessary paper  
which is often discarded . This takes us one step closer to less paper consumption in 
terms of sustainability . 
Change Description  
 
The Getting Started Guide which is enclosed within the box  of each camera  will be 
exchanged by  an universal  product inlay card.

Change Description 
With revision 106202 – 17  the model acA1300-60gmNIR gets a new firmware vers ion.  
 
Reason for Change 
The firmware change was necessary to adapt the sens or behavior especially the 
saturation capacity due to production variation of the sensor manufacturer, but we 
make sure that it is within our camera test specifi cation.  
Due to production variation of the sensor manufactu rer – especially at the production 
of the silicon for sensors – it could came to minim al deviation of sensor behavior. This 
could appear at lower saturation capacity or bloomi ng effect at long exposure times 
and high gain on the other hand. 
Basler optimize this sensor behavior with the new f irmware to deliver the familiar 
quality at its best.

Title:  Basler SLP Controller now up to  
100ms pulse width  
Product Family:  Basler Lighting  
Release date:  27 November , 2020 
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
To provide our customers the best poss ible images, we continuously listen to the 
feedback of our customers  to improve their machines and applications.  
In particular, customers who use rolling shutter sensors and are already enthusiastic 
about the Basler SLP feature have asked for a longer pulse width of the SLP controlle r. 
Therefore, the Basler SLP Controller will now support a pulse width of 50µs up to 
100ms.  
We are very pleased that the new Basler SLP feature , which drives down the effort to 
integrate lightings in a vision system strongly , has been so well received from our 
customers.  
Further information about this feature can be found on:  
https://www.baslerweb.com/en/products/vision -components/basler -lighting/  
 
Change Description  
Basler SLP is an easy way to add lighting to a vision system.  
The Basler SLP camera feature enables the Basler SLP controller  to be used together 
with the all our popular ace U and ace L cameras . PRODUCT CHANGE NOTIFICATION

The feature enables the direct communication between the Basler SLP Controller and 
the camera, allowing the lighting to be easily operated in different modes such as 
continuous, strobe or overdrive.  
When using the Basler SLP Controller, the user can also b enefit from the compatibility 
with the Basler SLP feature and gain access to the simple lighting concept vi a a uniform 
software interface - Basler pylon Camera Software Suite . 
In addition users are given the freedom to choose from a variety of standard lig ht 
sources or use their own.  The solution is suitable for users with lighting experience who 
have applications with specific lighting requirements.  
Based on customer feedback, we have now extended the pulse width . Before this 
change a pulse width of  50µs up to 5 ms. Now each newly ordered Basler SLP Controller 
will support a pulse width of 50µs up to 100ms .  
We are happy that the Basler SLP Controller is now also the right choice for applications 
that require a longer pulse width.

Reason for Change  
The CXP -12 product bundles were offered with the introduction of the boost camera 
series and interface card series . The successful expansion of both co mponent series 
also entailed the expansion of the bundle offering. In order to continue to implement 
and offer new requirements f or product combinations, bundle offers  will be stopp ed in 
favor of ordering individual components. This will make the ordering process more 
flexible and convenient.  The PCN describes the change in the product range and 
orderin g process.  
 
Change Description  
CXP-12 product bundles are no longer offered and can be replic ated by ordering the 
respective individual components, consisting of a boost camera model and an 
Interface Card IC -1C. 
Important : The individual components boost CXP-12 camera s and CXP-12 Interface 
Cards are still available and remain technically unchanged.

Title:  Firmware Update on         
acA640 -121gm  
Product Family:  ace U 
Release date:  29.04. 2019  
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
To provide our customers the best possible  replacement camera for the discontinued 
CCD sensor ICX618 , Basler  developed and just recently launched  the acA640 -121gm .  
In some cases users experience d long times for opening the camera. This long 
opening times are caused by the poor performance of olde r GenICam versions in 
caching the more complex GenICam XML Files in current cameras.  
In order to resolve that issue a more recent GenICam version or a new camera 
firmware is required.   
With this firmware release the acA640 -121gm comes along with two different XML 
Files in order to allow the best performance in both cases.  
 
Further information about  Baslers unique 1:1 replacement camera  acA640 -121 can be 
found on:

Change Description  
With this firmware release of FW1.1 -0 the acA640 -121gm comes along with two 
different XML Files.  
Due to the explained intended use as a replacement camera  for older camera models , 
the XML File for an improved behavior with older SDK/GenICam versions is set by 
default.  
If customers want to use the fully equipped feature set (e.g. including USEM, 
Sequencer, PGI, etc.) and are using a new SDK/GenICam version, it is possible to 
switch the XML file.

Reason for Change  
We optimized the mechanical design of the C23 5MP lens series to improve the 
adjustability and overall accuracy of the aperture. Due to this optimization the min F -
number  of the C23 5MP 16mm and 35mm lenses had to be changed.  
 
Change Description  
The minimum F-number ha d to be changed from f/1.8 to f/ 2.0. This was necessary 
due to overlapping tolerances. This should not be noticed in most applications and we 
don’t expect any impact on your system.  
Please note that the n aming has  change d too (see list below).

Title:  IR-Cut Filter  change  on  
dedicated  ace U cameras  
Product Family:  ace U 
Release date:  November 11 , 2021   
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
Due to ong oing optimizations and process  improvements we changed the IR cut f ilter 
and der f ilter holder (also know n as “passepartout ”) for dedicated  ace U models.  
Change Description  
 
Effected models:  
- ace U with Python  300, Python  500 and Python1300 Sensors 
- ace U with IMX252 and IMX265 Sensors  
Please see detailed list with a ffected camera models below.  
The following pictures show a n IMX265 Sensor, where the difference is visible. The 
passepartout appears  a little bit smaller than the old one  and reduces diffused light. 
The specification  of the IR- Cut filter and their transmission did not change.

CUSTOMER STORYAlitheon Software and Basler ace Give Identity 
to Components Without the Use of Labels or 
Markings
Customer
 Alitheon, Inc. 
 Location: Bellevue, Washington, USA
 Industry: Factory Automation / Industrial Software
 Implementation: 2020
Application
Each year, global manufacturers and their suppliers 
deliver increasingly sophisticated products to their  
customers. Advanced vehicles, electronics, and other 
engineered goods now reach their markets through a 
precise physical and digital orchestration, with every 
component playing a role for quality and performance. 
Products such as, fasteners, circuit boards, castings, and 
even textiles must now be “smart” – uniquely identified 
and individually traceable. Yet these high-volume parts 
often resist identification, their design incompatible with 
barcode labels, etchings, or packaging. Alitheon was 
founded to solve this problem with a universal traceabi -
lity model, providing item-level certainty without altering 
product designs or manufacturing processes. With just a 
camera in the factory or in the field, Alitheon technology 
verifies the identity of virtually any object using software 
algorithms.
Through contactless machine vision, Alitheon software 
analyses the surface of every unique product or part, 
generating a digital code that differentiates it from even 
millions of seemingly identical objects. This FeaturePrint™ 
ID represents an authoritative, virtual serial number that 
can be stored, checked, and rechecked over an object’s 
entire useful life. In factory settings, FeaturePrint soft -
ware retrofits existing production lines through conti -
nuous-duty industrial cameras. With automated optics 
and sensors in place, even decades-old factory sites can 
easily receive an all-new digital control system to track 
goods. FeaturePrint endpoints can be attached to 
machine cells or operator stations, verifying the  
production flow, and generating data for the enterprise. 
Once a FeaturePrint ID is captured, it is available via cloud 
systems to allow goods to be verified anywhere – in 
plants, distribution channels, or with end users using a mobile app. In order to allow clear identification, Alitheon 
searched for a camera with the ability to capture even the 
smallest details and often during fast moving production 
lines.
Solution and Benefits 
Alitheon specifies Basler products through its Feature -
Print Automate and Feature Print Station components. 
Deployed within a machine retrofit chassis or a benchtop 
form factor, Basler ace L and Classic cameras generate 
images that keep up with production lines. In an automo -
tive setting, a powertrain part may transform through 
automated stages including raw stock, machining, heat 
treating, and grinding. In this case, a Basler camera ope -
rates at each of these four steps, triggering Alitheon’s 
FeaturePrint processing and ensuring continuous quality 
control. Or, in a contract electronics manufacturing 
scenario, a team of skilled operators may utilize multiple 
camera stations powered by Basler cameras and Alitheon 
technology to guide the correct assembly of circuit 
boards and modules. Later, in field service or aftermarket 
settings, the FeaturePrint ID originally generated onsite is 
available for product verification within a mobile app.

which the camera is delivered.   
This change will lead to a better quality of information for our customers by using our 
online product documentation.  Furthermore, we avoid the usage of  unnecessary paper  
which is often discarded . This takes us one step closer to less paper consumption in 
terms of sustainability . 
Change Description  
 
The Getting Started Guide which is enclosed within the box  of each camera  will be 
exchanged by  an universal  product inlay card.

Reason for Change  
Due to the fact that our standa rd cables did not fit with our  previous  Basler GigE 
Interface C ard, 4 port, a new card was added to the portfolio instead.  The ports of the 
old card were too close together, which is why the cables did not fit.  
Change Description  
There are no technical or quality changes. The only change is the design of the card

Reason for Change  
 
Due to  the tense  demand -supply -situation we decided to remove  a temperature 
sensor which faced a shortage from our ace U and ace L cameras  in Q3/2021 . We 
focused on delivering cameras and reduced the feature scope.  
The Device Temperature Feature  was of no use and the Temperature State 
Feature  was deactivated.  
 
For further information please  see the published PCN’s from our website:   
Device Temperature Feature removed Part 1  
Device Temperature Feature removed Part 2  
Device Temperature Feature removed Part 3  
 
Now the temperature sensor is available again and we  change all cameras listed 
in the above mentioned PCNs back  to the original feature scope.

The Device Temperature camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the cameras (see Basler Product Documentation ). The feature will 
return a correct value agai n and no longer the default value of 421°C.  
 
The Temperature State  camera feature  (see Basler Product Documentation ) 
indicates whether the cameras internal temperature is normal or too high.  In case of 
over temperature, the image acquisition is stopped and a test image appears until the 
camera has cooled down again.  This feature will be activated again and work as 
before .   
Firmware updates are not possible for cameras which were  produced without 
temperature sensor. With this product change a firmware update to future firmware 
versions will be possible again.

Title:  Barcode Change on Product 
Packages  
Product Family:  Basler cameras   
Release date:  January  17th, 2023 
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
We as Basler see the traceability of our cameras as very important and equip our 
cameras  with a serial number on the camera itself and on the product outer package.  
The label on the camera outer  package lists the serial number in a barcode which is 
design ed and used especially for internal automated processes. Due to important 
internal system adaptions Basler needs to change the conte nt of the serial number 
barcode  shortly.  The following example shows a product package label with the 
affected barcode marke d red:  
  
We as Basler know about the importance of such an information and can imagine  that 
you as our customer process this information inside  your system as well.  Therefore, 
we would like to inform you herewith about this change and advise you to familiarize 
your scanning system with the new content . The change will take place s hort term 
beginning calendar week  3 in January 2023.

Title:  New material codes for dart BCON for 
LVDS models / Development Kits  
Product Family:  dart BCON for LVDS, Development Kits  
Release date:  January 25 , 2018  
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
 
Basler ’s embedded port folio exists  of camera modules and accompanying 
development kits. Up to  date the development kits have fallen under the product 
category  PowerPack s. In preparation for future portfolio extension s a new pr oduct 
category “Development Kits ” has now been created . As a consequence, the product 
type of the current development kits has changed accordingly.  
The dart BCON for LVDS is Basler’s first camera module with a low -level embedded 
interfac e. BCON is Basler’s proprietary interface technology for embedded systems. In 
preparation for future portfolio extensions based on BCON technology the material 
codes for all dart BCON for LVDS models have changed.  
 
Change Description  
 
In Basler’s material  codes the second last letter describes which interface the camera 
or camera module provides.   
Example:  daA1280 -54bm  
For all dart BCON for LVDS models this letter has now changed from b (BCON)  to l 
(LVDS).   
Example:  daA1280 -54lm  
Please find below a list of all dart BCON for LVDS models with new material codes.

Reason for Change  
 
Due to the ongoing component crisis, our supplier ADLINK has adapted the electrical 
design of the PCIe -GIE74.  
The standard functions of the interface card remain unchanged.  
If the ADLINK SDK is used for special functions, a new validation is recommended.  
Change Description  
 
The new design has replaced different power components, a micro controller and the 
PCIe switch. For normal use cases without using the ADLINK SDK for POE controlling 
the new version can be used.

Change Description 
In the design of the camera’s coreboard some improv ements were made. One change 
is implementing a new voltage regulation by changin g the input voltage and 
implementing a switch. Furthermore the layout was o ptimized. 
 
Reason for Change 
The change was originally made to reduce the power consumption of new high 
resolution and high speed camera models as for exam ple the acA2500-60um/uc.  
As these models and following camera models are sti ll under development, the mass 
production of these models will already start with the new coreboard.

 For the cameras listed in this Product Change Notif ication the new coreboard was 
implemented as well to benefit from the stated impr ovements.  
The exact power reduction is depending on your appl ication and setup of the camera 
as well as other conditions as ambient temperature etc. In the following table you see 
one exemplary measurement that was done with an acA 1920-155uc with the full AOI.

Reason for Change 
To provide our customers the best color images we a lways try to improve our 
cameras. In this case we changed the color presets in the color matrix that are 
measured in our laboratories with exemplary light s ettings to reduce the color error. 
 
Change Description 
By changing the values in the color matrix it was p ossible to reduce the color error 
DeltaE00 from 6.13 to 2.37. This results in better colors if you compare them on the 
color checker.

CUSTOMER STORYAOI System with Frame Grabbers and FPGA 
Applet from Silicon Software 
Delvitech from Switzerland offers automatic optical inspection (AOI) to prevent process errors, increase the yield 
and reduce the costs in the manufacturing of assembled printed circuit boards (PCB). The core element of these 
systems is an optical head consisting of five cameras and various side-mounted illuminations. The company recently 
developed a new head upgrade for its AOI systems installed in the market, with more powerful cameras and frame 
grabbers – and is now benefiting of important sales, offering solutions significantly better with higher speed, 
improved detectability and greater flexibility. 
Delvitech needed new cameras for the optical head, as 
the existing ones lagged behind the desired high image 
quality. The cameras had to achieve a higher resolution, 
have suitable interfaces to the new frame grabbers and 
acquire at least 30 frames per second. For the scalability 
of the system, the interchangeability of cameras and 
frame grabbers was an important requirement, indepen -
dent of the camera interface and without changing the 
image processing software developed in-house. 
In the optical head there are a camera at the top and four 
cameras at the side together with 24 xenon light sources, 
4 RGB leds and a special sensor. A monochrome CMOS 
area scan camera 25 Mpixel with CoaXPress interface 
was selected for the upper camera instead of the pre -
vious 4 MP resolution camera. Four monochrome Camera 
Link Basler ace CMOS with 4 MP resolution and 180 
frames per second are now used for the side cameras 
replacing the previous analog ones. The upper camera 
has a larger sensor so that fine features can be better 
resolved or the same level of performance can be main -
tained at a higher throughput. Due to the also larger 
sensors of the side cameras, discrepancies in the resolu -
tion between all cameras are reduced. The selected 
cameras are dimensioned to run below their potential 
performance and therefore allow the performance of the 
system to be enhanced at a later stage. Scalability and Great Flexibility 
The disadvantage of the frame grabbers used so far was 
that they were only suitable for special cameras and were 
incompatible with the new high performance cameras 
selected, the intended light sources and the self-deve -
loped software based on algorithms with artificial intelli -
gence. Therefore Delvitech chose two different program -
mable frame grabbers from Silicon Software, both com -
patible with diverse cameras and lighting as well as the 
software. The upper camera, four side cameras and the 
lighting are synchronized by the microEnable 5 VCX-QP 
CoaXPress frame grabber, while the up to four side 
cameras are triggered by two Camera Link frame grab -
bers microEnable 5 VCL. With the system upgrade, Del -
vitech also switched to the very powerful 64bit D.ONE 
Core. 
The system was designed for scalability with the use of 
one standard camera up to five high-end cameras in the 
highest expansion stage, which the frame grabbers 
support. In order to connect them to the software, the 
project partners jointly developed image acquisition 
functions as a hardware applet using the FPGA develop -
ment environment VisualApplets from Silicon Software 
with the advantage that the frame grabbers, already 
during the image transfer, always generate the same 
output format. This means that the software can be easily 
further used when changing cameras, frame grabbers or 
the camera interface. The applet was designed as a data 
flow model and synthesized as FPGA code for the runtime 
environment on the frame grabber. The overall imple -
mentation of hardware, software and applet was com -
pleted within a few days. “We owe the short development 
time to Silicon Software‘s extraordinary consulting com -
petence and operational readiness. On the basis of only 
two coaching sessions the design-in could be completed 
entirely,” explains Roberto Gatti, VP Sales and Marketing 
of Delvitech.

High-Quality Software Included 
When inspecting assembled printed circuit boards, the 
AOI system on the one hand checks the presence, 
absence, the polarity, the names, the colors, the polari -
ties, and the correct positioning of the components. On 
the other hand, it inspects the shape of the solder joints 
by their form detecting opens, shorts, cold solder joints 
and any type of defects related to wrong solder joints on 
reflow and wave applications. For this purpose, a part of 
the printed circuit board is illuminated according to the 
specifications of the software using RGB led, whereupon 
one or more cameras trigger and take images with color 
reflection. This creates one or more images from different 
angles, whose colors are later reconstructed using the 
Delvitech software. The frame grabbers synchronize the 
triggering of the cameras and the numerous light sources 
via a flash controller. After image acquisition, the images 
are corrected by the software in the course of image pre -
processing, for example their orientation. The AOI image processing system with the optical head is 
used in production plants. Due to the now given higher 
camera resolution, it achieves significantly better measu -
rement results at four times the speed and higher frame 
rate. This means that considerably more examinations of 
printed circuit boards can be carried out per minute – at 
the same cost of the overall system. The system now pro -
cesses images in just half a second, from acquisition and 
image pre-processing to merging and comparing the 
images, analyzing them and outputting the results. “The 
components can be flexibly exchanged and scaled 
regardless of the camera model and interface, and the 
system can be easily adapted to new customer require -
ments thanks to the accompanying applet,” states Gatti. 
In order to meet these requirements in the future, an 
extension of the system to 3D inspection with stereo 
vision is planned, which would further optimize the 
system.

Reason for Change  
The demand -supply -situation for semiconductor -related components has become 
increasingly tense  and it  is our utmost aim to provide our customers  with the most 
reliable and competitive lead times possible in this challenging environment .  
One component that faces a s hortage is a temperatu re sensor that is needed for the 
“Device Temperature  Feature ” and the “Temperature State Feature ”.  
Due to the shortage of the temperature sensor we will focus on delivering cameras 
and reduce the  feature scope . The “Device Temperature F eature ” won’t be of  use 
anymore and the “Temperature State Feature ” will be deactivated for the cameras 
listed below.   
We manage to stay within the UL certifications, but this means the cameras may only 
be operate d with a lens  or any other heat dissipating device . 
Once the demand -supply -situation  has relaxed, we plan to offer both feature s again. 
This will be published in another Product Change Notification.  
 
Affected cameras  (detailed list of models below):

Change Description  
 
The following Temperature R equirements  are specified in our Basler Product 
Documentation to operate the cameras listed below.  
Housing Temperature during operation  0-50 °C  
Housing Temperature according to UL  max. 70°C  
Ambient Temperature according to UL  max. 30°C  
UL test conditions : no lens attached to camera; no heat dissipation measures; 
ambient temperature kept at 30°C.  
 
The temperature limits will not change. However, to stay in accordance with UL  the 
test conditions were changed: cameras need to always be equipped with a lens . No 
camera exceeds the UL temperature limit of 70°C and all cameras will keep their UL 
certification.  
Please note that t o avoid burns or damaging the camera you must never use the 
camera without a lens  or alternative heat dissipation  to operate  the camera  
according to the specified maximum housing temperature of 50°C .  
 
 
The Device Temperature  camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the camera  (see Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below , the feature will still be accessible. However, 
because the se cameras will not be equipped with the temperature sensor, a  default  
value of 421°C  will be returned .

The Temperature State  camera feature indicates whether the camera's internal 
temperature is normal or too high.  In case of over temperature , the image acquisition 
is stopped and a  test image appears until the camera has cooled down again  (see 
Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below, the feature will be deactiva ted by removing the 
temperature thresholds. It will always return the parameter value “ok”.   
 
The over temperature threshold is for the following two purposes:  
1) Ensuring UL conformity of the camera .  
This requirement is still fulfilled as described  above.   
 
2) Preventing damage of the camera.   
At elevated temperatures, the camera may get damaged, the camera's lifetime is 
shortened, and image quality can degrade.  We therefore ask you to take special care 
to provide sufficient heat dissipation to maintain the temperat ure of the camera 
housing at 50 °C or less .  
 
If sufficient heat dissipation is provided in the application and cameras are operated 
according to the specified maximum housing temperature of 50°C , this product 
change does not have an impact on heat development within the camera.  
In case cameras in your application have switched to test images before (please see 
“Temperature State Feature” ), your application might exceed the specified operating 
temperature  and additional measures to provide sufficient heat dissipation might be 
needed. Please contact our Basle r Support team for assistance.  
If cameras in your  application haven’t switched  to test images before, the removed 
thresholds will have no  consequence.  
 
Please note that  you won’t be able to update future firmware versions on cameras that 
were produced  without the temperature sensor.

Reason for Change  
In order to serve  the high demand on our C23 5MP Premium Lens series we decided 
to accept slightly different mechanical parts on the outside of the lens. The 
appearance slightly differs, but this difference does not lead to any change in the 
usability or technical performance of the lens.  
Change Description  
 
The following picture shows the differences that can occur on this Lens s eries.  
Please be informed that both product designs can be delivered.  
 
 
- the silver ring is matt or shiny  
 
 
- the riffles of the adjustment rings are 
flat or deep

Title: Simplified licensing model of 
VisualApplets  
Product Family: VisualApplets 
Release date:  November 1st, 2022  
Contact:     Basler Support  
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous     Firmware     PC Software 
 Product design   Process  
 
Reason for Change 
 
To enhance VisualApplets for Basler customers, the VisualApplets licensing model will 
be simplified starting with VisualApplets version 3.3.2.  
 
Change Description 
 
Starting from November 1st 2022, all licenses for previous VisualApplets extensions, 
e.g., VisualApplets 3 Expert License, VisualApplets 3 Debugging License, 
VisualApplets 3 Parameters Translation License, VA3 LIB JPEG Compression 
License, VA3 LIB Segment./Classification License, will be discontinued.  
Instead, these licenses will be automatically included into the VisualApplets IDE 
License. 
The same change also affects all corresponding VisualApplets test licenses, which will 
be included into the VisualApplets IDE (Eval.) License. 
The changes will be effective with VisualApplets version 3.3.2 and will apply to all 
upcoming VisualApplets versions.

Customers with a VisualApplets 3 IDE License valid for VisualApplets versions before 
3.3.2 have to purchase the new VisualApplets IDE License to benefit from the 
simplified licensing introduced with VisualApplets 3.3.2 and to be able to use 
upcoming VisualApplets versions, e.g., VisualApplets 4.x.

Title:  Device Temperature Feature – 
Removed on certain ace U and ace 
L cameras  
Product Family:  ace U and  ace L  with certain sensors  
Release date:  August 16, 2021 
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
The demand -supply -situation for semiconductor -related components has become 
increasingly tense  and it  is our utmost aim to provide our customers  with the most 
reliable and competitive lead times possible in this challenging environment .  
One component that faces a s hortage is a temperature sensor that is needed for the 
Device Temperature camera feature . This feature has never been officially supported 
and listed in our Basler Product Documentation for the cameras listed below. 
However, for the convenience of our customers it was available anyway.     
Due to the shortage of the temperature sensor we will focus on delivering cameras 
and go back to the officially stated feature scope . The Device Temperature camera 
feature won’t be of use  anymore for the cameras listed below.   
Once the demand -supply -situation has relaxed, we plan to offer the feature again. 
This will be published in another Product Change Notification.  
 
Affected cameras (detailed  list of models below):   
 ace L GigE  (IMX267, IMX304)  
 ace U USB (IMX226, IMX178)  
 ace U GigE (IMX226, IMX178)

Change Description  
 
The Device Temperature  camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the camera  (see Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below , the feature will still be accessible. However, 
because the se cameras will not be equipped with the temperature sensor, a  default  
value of 421°C  will be returned .   
 
The related  Temperature State  camera feature indicates whether the camera's 
internal temperature is normal or too high.  In case of over temperature , the image 
acquisition is stopped and a  test image appears until the camera has cooled down 
again.  
As stated in our Basler Product Documentation , the feature has never been supported 
by these cameras.  Nevertheless in pylon Viewer the feature has always shown the 
parameter value  “ok”, this will not change . 
   
This change does not have any impact on heat development within the cameras.

Title:  Firmware  Update For ace 2 
Cameras  
Product Family:  ace 2  
Release date:  June  17, 2020 (PM)  
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
There are two main reasons for this new firmware release:  
1. We fixed a b ug in our ace 2 models which mainly limited the possible speed 
increase for our Compression Beyond feature on ace 2 GigE cameras.  
2. We added a new High Speed Burst Mode, allowing the user to trigger a 
predefined burst of images at the maximum sensor speed possible in our 
hardware.  
 
Change Description  
1. Fixed Bug  
The fixed behavior of our camera now allows the user to achieve a factor two increase 
in speed on ace 2 Pro GigE cameras by using the Compression Beyond feature. The 
accurate increase heavily depends on the working point of the camera (pixel form at, 
ROI, etc.).  
2. New High Speed Burst Mode  
Usually, the frame rate of the camera is not only limited by its sensor and internal 
buffer, but also by its ability to transfer data. This includes, e.g., the interface 
bandwidth or your network setup.  
The High Speed burst mode allows you to work around these data transfer limitations 
and acquire a burst of images as quickly as possible.  PRODUCT CHANGE NOTIFICATION

To achieve this, during a burst, acquiring images and filling the camera's internal 
buffer is highly prioritized over transmitt ing data. Usually, images will be transmitted 
only after all images of a burst have been acquired. This may introduce a delay after 
each burst, i.e., lower the burst rate.

documentation .

Change Description  
Sequencer  
The Sequencer  camera feature  allows you to define sets of parameter settings, called 
sequencer sets, and apply them to a sequence of image acquisitions.  
As the camera acquires images, it applies one sequencer set after the other. This 
enables you to quickly change camera parameters without compromising the 
maximum frame rate.  
For further information about  this feature  please take a look at our product 
documentation  or contact the Basler Support.  
 
Static Defect Pixel Correction  
The Defect Pixel Correction  camera feature  allows you to minimize the influence of 
sensitivity differences of individual pixels of the sensor.  
In acquired images, some pixels may appear significantly brighter or darker than the 
rest, even if uniform light is used. This problem is caused by differences in sensitivity 
of the individual pixels which in turn are due to production tolerances.  
The Static Defect Pixel Correction is based on files that are stored on the camera and 
contain a list of defect pixel coordinates.  
The following defect pixel correction files can be stored on the camera:  
• Factory file: Contains the coordinates of defect pixels that were detected during 
camera production. With this file, the camera corrects pixels that have a 
significantly  lower  intensity value than the neighboring pixels, including 
completely black pixels.  
• User fil e: Contains user -defined coordinates. You can upload this file to the 
camera. This allows you to define new defect pixels that might have occurred  
over time, regardless of whether these pixels are too dark or too bright.  
For further information about this  feature  please take a look at our product 
documentation  or contact the Basler Support.

CUSTOMER STORYMulti-talented: Basler boost with Customized 
Interface Card in a Line Scan Application
Customer
 MJV-Sähkö Oy and Lateral Engine Oy
 Location:  Lahti, Finland and Espoo, Finland
 Industry: Factory Automation
 Implementation: 2019-2020
Application
MJV-Sähkö Oy delivers machine vision systems with 
parameterization capability for the sorting of plywood 
sheets for the plywood industry. In their automation pro -
jects such as veneer grading it is important to work with 
efficient, up-to-date automation systems to achieve high 
productivity. The veneer grading process often uses line 
scan cameras that require a complex installation process. 
This is why MJV-Sähkö Oy was looking for a color area 
scan camera that not only fulfils the requirements for the 
inspection process of the veneer grading, but can also be 
installed easily.Solution and Benefits
In the veneer sheet grading application, the sheets (e.g. 
1800 mm wide) are imaged on a conveyor using high-
resolution line scan imaging. Software analyzes the 
sheets using modern deep-learning techniques and the 
results can be used by the manufacturing system for 
various purposes such as separating the sheets into diffe -
rent grades or splicing the material.
“There is nothing revolutionary in line scan applications 
but the novelty at the core of this Customer Story is how 
we communicated with Basler to implement a Basler area 
scan camera for the imaging”, states Jaakko Rantala from 
Lateral Engine Oy. The basic idea is to configure the 
camera and the interface card so that the camera uses an 
AOI of only a few lines at a very high frame rate (e.g. 4 
lines @ 2000 Hz, triggered by an encoder interface). The 
chunks of grouped lines are then efficiently stitched 
together on the interface card side before transferring 
the complete frames to the host software.
This was made possible by following:
 High-resolution CMOS sensor of the Basler boost 
camera
 High bandwidth achieved by the CoaXPress 2.0 
interface (Basler boost camera + Basler CXP-12 
interface card)
 Most importantly: the excellent collaboration with 
Basler in which the interface card was upgraded to 
support new features. The features consist of the line 
stitching and an encoder interface for camera 
triggering.

Title:  Temperature State Feature – 
Removed on certain ace U and ace 
L cameras  
Product Family:  ace U and  ace L  with certain sensors  
Release date:  August 23, 2021 
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
The demand -supply -situation for semiconductor -related components has become 
increasingly tense  and it  is our utmost aim to provide our customers  with the most 
reliable and competitive lead times possible in this challenging environment .  
One component that faces a s hortage is a temperature sensor that is needed for the 
“Device Temperature  Feature ” and the “Temperature State Feature ”.  
Due to the shortage of the temperature sensor we will focus on delivering cameras 
and reduce the  feature scope . The “Device Temperature F eature ” won’t be of use  
anymore and the “Temperature State Feature ” will be deactivated for the cameras 
listed below.   
Once the demand -supply -situation  has relaxed, we plan to offer both feature s again. 
This will be published in another Product Change Notification.  
 
Affected cameras  (detailed list of models below):  
 
 ace U GigE with IMX183, IMX265, Python  300, Python 500 and Python  1300 
Sensor   
 ace U USB with IMX273 mono, IMX265 mono, IMX264 m ono, IMX287 and 
Python  300 Sensor  
 
Depending on the  stock situation we might expand this measure to further cameras 
models soon.

We share this  initial version of the Product Change Notification by email once and 
publish updates  later on our Website. Therefore please closely monitor th is Product 
Change Notification on our Website . All recent updates are marked in red.  
 
Change Description  
 
The following Temperature R equirements  are specified in our Basler Product 
Documentation to operate the cameras listed below. These Requirements are still 
valid and will not change.  
Housing Temperature during operation  0-50 °C  
Housing Temperature according to UL 60950 -1 max. 70°C  
Ambient Temperature according to UL 60950 -1 max. 30°C  
UL 60950 -1 test conditions: no lens attached to camera; no heat dissipation 
measures; ambient temperature kept at 30°C.  
 
The Device Temperature  camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the camera  (see Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below , the feature will  still be accessible. However, 
because the se cameras will not be equipped with the temperature sensor, a  default  
value of 421°C  will be returned .   
 
The Temperature State  camera feature indicates whether the camera's internal 
temperature is normal or too high.  In case of over temperature , the image acquisition 
is stopped and a  test image appears until the camera has cooled down again  (see 
Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below, the feature will be deactivated by removing the 
temperature thresholds. It will always return the parameter value “ok”.

The over temperature threshold used to serve two purposes:  
1) Ensuring UL conformity of the camera .  
This requirement is still fulfilled. The threshold is only removed from models that do 
not exceed the maximum 70°C Housing Temperature according to UL 60950 -1.  
 
2) Preventing damage of the camera.   
At elevated temperatures, the camera may get damaged, the camera's lifetime is 
shortened, and image quality can degrade.  We therefore ask you to take special care 
to provide sufficient heat dissipation to maintain the temperat ure of the camera 
housing at 50 °C or less .  
 
If sufficient heat dissipation is provided in the application and cameras are operated 
according to the specified maximum housing temperature of 50°C , this product 
change does not have an impact on heat development within the camera.  
In case cameras in your application have switched to test images before (please see 
“Temperature State Feature” ), your application might exceed the specified operating 
temperature  and additional measures to provide sufficient heat dissipation might be 
needed. Please contact our Basle r Support team for assistance.  
If cameras in your  application haven’t switched  to test images before, the removed 
thresholds will have no  consequence.  
 
Please note that  you won’t be able to update future firmware versions on cameras that 
were produced  without the temperature sensor.

Title:  Change of packaging and MOQ for all 
dart models  
Product Family:  dart (all models)  
Release date:  January 15 , 2018  
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
Due to persistent  problems in logistics, inventory management and release 
management caused by single dart orders associated  with loans  and general design 
sample  as well as  custom dart prototype distribution all dart models (dar t USB, dart 
BCON for LVDS) are  now shipped  in single packaged units.  
 
Change Description  
To date , the dart USB as well as the dart BCON for LVDS camera modules have been  
shipped in package units of 5 cameras. Also, the minimum order  quantity for all dart 
models has been  5 pieces . Starting from January 15th 2018   this will change and all 
dart models (dart USB, dart BCON for LVDS) will be shipped to customers in single 
packaged units . In a ddition to that the MOQ is reduced to 1 piece for all models.  
The changeover to individual packaging has no effect on the current list prices of the 
dart family (dart USB, dart BCON for LVDS). Also, w ith changing the  minimum order 
quantity, all customers are no longer obliged to order a multiple of 5 dart cameras.

Title:  Vignetting Correction for several 
ace models  
Product Family: ace U and ace L 
Release date:  September 16, 2019  
Contact:     Basler Support  
Type of Change:

Reason for Change 
To provide our customers the best possible images, we always think of new features 
that help customers to improve their machines and a pplications. 
The most recent feature of this extension is Vignet ting Correction, which allows a 
correction of edge shadowing when the image circle is too small in relation to the 
sensor size.

Change Description 
Vignetting is a well-known phenomenon in image proc essing and describes the 
decrease in image brightness towards the edge. This  often results in this effect: 
           
Fig. 1 Left without Vignetting Correction Feature, R ight with Vignetting Correction Feature 
Our Vignetting Correction feature corrects this eff ect and at the same time there is no 
negative effect on the frame rate or image quality after a one-time calibration of the 
camera, since the correction values are stored in t he camera and automatically taken 
into account in the image output. 
Please note that you have to use pylon 5.2.0 or hig her to use the Vignetting Feature. 
Further details about the feature behavior and the usage can be found on: 
https://docs.baslerweb.com/#t=en%2Fvignetting_corre ction.htm

 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
We continuously optimize our products and processes. For this reason we decide d to 
optimize our Getting Started Guide.  The Getting Started Guide is a letter where we 
explain  how to get started with a camera . Until today it is  enclosed in every box within  
which  the camera is delivered.   
This change will lead to a better quality of information for our customers by using our 
online product documentation.  Furthermore, we avoid the usage of  unnecessary paper  
which is often discarded . This takes us one step closer to less paper consumption in 
terms of sustainability . 
Change Description  
 
The Getting Started Guide which is enclosed within the box  of each camera  will be 
exchanged by  an universal  product inlay card.

Change Description 
With revision 106202 – 17  the model acA1300-60gmNIR gets a new firmware vers ion.  
 
Reason for Change 
The firmware change was necessary to adapt the sens or behavior especially the 
saturation capacity due to production variation of the sensor manufacturer, but we 
make sure that it is within our camera test specifi cation.  
Due to production variation of the sensor manufactu rer – especially at the production 
of the silicon for sensors – it could came to minim al deviation of sensor behavior. This 
could appear at lower saturation capacity or bloomi ng effect at long exposure times 
and high gain on the other hand. 
Basler optimize this sensor behavior with the new f irmware to deliver the familiar 
quality at its best.

 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
To provide our customers the best poss ible images, we continuously listen to the 
feedback of our customers  to improve their machines and applications.  
In particular, customers who use rolling shutter sensors and are already enthusiastic 
about the Basler SLP feature have asked for a longer pulse width of the SLP controlle r. 
Therefore, the Basler SLP Controller will now support a pulse width of 50µs up to 
100ms.  
We are very pleased that the new Basler SLP feature , which drives down the effort to 
integrate lightings in a vision system strongly , has been so well received from our 
customers.  
Further information about this feature can be found on:  
https://www.baslerweb.com/en/products/vision -components/basler -lighting/  
 
Change Description  
Basler SLP is an easy way to add lighting to a vision system.  
The Basler SLP camera feature enables the Basler SLP controller  to be used together 
with the all our popular ace U and ace L cameras . PRODUCT CHANGE NOTIFICATION

The feature enables the direct communication between the Basler SLP Controller and 
the camera, allowing the lighting to be easily operated in different modes such as 
continuous, strobe or overdrive.  
When using the Basler SLP Controller, the user can also b enefit from the compatibility 
with the Basler SLP feature and gain access to the simple lighting concept vi a a uniform 
software interface - Basler pylon Camera Software Suite . 
In addition users are given the freedom to choose from a variety of standard lig ht 
sources or use their own.  The solution is suitable for users with lighting experience who 
have applications with specific lighting requirements.  
Based on customer feedback, we have now extended the pulse width . Before this 
change a pulse width of  50µs up to 5 ms. Now each newly ordered Basler SLP Controller 
will support a pulse width of 50µs up to 100ms .  
We are happy that the Basler SLP Controller is now also the right choice for applications 
that require a longer pulse width.

Title:  Firmware Update on         
acA640 -121gm  
Product Family:  ace U 
Release date:  29.04. 2019  
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
To provide our customers the best possible  replacement camera for the discontinued 
CCD sensor ICX618 , Basler  developed and just recently launched  the acA640 -121gm .  
In some cases users experience d long times for opening the camera. This long 
opening times are caused by the poor performance of olde r GenICam versions in 
caching the more complex GenICam XML Files in current cameras.  
In order to resolve that issue a more recent GenICam version or a new camera 
firmware is required.   
With this firmware release the acA640 -121gm comes along with two different XML 
Files in order to allow the best performance in both cases.

Change Description  
With this firmware release of FW1.1 -0 the acA640 -121gm comes along with two 
different XML Files.  
Due to the explained intended use as a replacement camera  for older camera models , 
the XML File for an improved behavior with older SDK/GenICam versions is set by 
default.  
If customers want to use the fully equipped feature set (e.g. including USEM, 
Sequencer, PGI, etc.) and are using a new SDK/GenICam version, it is possible to 
switch the XML file.

Reason for Change  
We optimized the mechanical design of the C23 5MP lens series to improve the 
adjustability and overall accuracy of the aperture. Due to this optimization the min F -
number  of the C23 5MP 16mm and 35mm lenses had to be changed.  
 
Change Description  
The minimum F-number ha d to be changed from f/1.8 to f/ 2.0. This was necessary 
due to overlapping tolerances. This should not be noticed in most applications and we 
don’t expect any impact on your system.  
Please note that the n aming has  change d too (see list below).

Title:  IR-Cut Filter  change  on  
dedicated  ace U cameras  
Product Family:  ace U

 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
Due to ong oing optimizations and process  improvements we changed the IR cut f ilter 
and der f ilter holder (also know n as “passepartout ”) for dedicated  ace U models.  
Change Description  
 
Effected models:  
- ace U with Python  300, Python  500 and Python1300 Sensors 
- ace U with IMX252 and IMX265 Sensors  
Please see detailed list with a ffected camera models below.  
The following pictures show a n IMX265 Sensor, where the difference is visible. The 
passepartout appears  a little bit smaller than the old one  and reduces diffused light. 
The specification  of the IR- Cut filter and their transmission did not change.

CUSTOMER STORYAlitheon Software and Basler ace Give Identity 
to Components Without the Use of Labels or 
Markings
Customer
 Alitheon, Inc. 
 Location: Bellevue, Washington, USA
 Industry: Factory Automation / Industrial Software
 Implementation: 2020
Application
Each year, global manufacturers and their suppliers 
deliver increasingly sophisticated products to their  
customers. Advanced vehicles, electronics, and other 
engineered goods now reach their markets through a 
precise physical and digital orchestration, with every 
component playing a role for quality and performance. 
Products such as, fasteners, circuit boards, castings, and 
even textiles must now be “smart” – uniquely identified 
and individually traceable. Yet these high-volume parts 
often resist identification, their design incompatible with 
barcode labels, etchings, or packaging. Alitheon was 
founded to solve this problem with a universal traceabi -
lity model, providing item-level certainty without altering 
product designs or manufacturing processes. With just a 
camera in the factory or in the field, Alitheon technology 
verifies the identity of virtually any object using software 
algorithms.
Through contactless machine vision, Alitheon software 
analyses the surface of every unique product or part, 
generating a digital code that differentiates it from even 
millions of seemingly identical objects. This FeaturePrint™ 
ID represents an authoritative, virtual serial number that 
can be stored, checked, and rechecked over an object’s 
entire useful life. In factory settings, FeaturePrint soft -
ware retrofits existing production lines through conti -
nuous-duty industrial cameras. With automated optics 
and sensors in place, even decades-old factory sites can 
easily receive an all-new digital control system to track 
goods. FeaturePrint endpoints can be attached to 
machine cells or operator stations, verifying the  
production flow, and generating data for the enterprise. 
Once a FeaturePrint ID is captured, it is available via cloud 
systems to allow goods to be verified anywhere – in 
plants, distribution channels, or with end users using a mobile app. In order to allow clear identification, Alitheon 
searched for a camera with the ability to capture even the 
smallest details and often during fast moving production 
lines.
Solution and Benefits 
Alitheon specifies Basler products through its Feature -
Print Automate and Feature Print Station components. 
Deployed within a machine retrofit chassis or a benchtop 
form factor, Basler ace L and Classic cameras generate 
images that keep up with production lines. In an automo -
tive setting, a powertrain part may transform through 
automated stages including raw stock, machining, heat 
treating, and grinding. In this case, a Basler camera ope -
rates at each of these four steps, triggering Alitheon’s 
FeaturePrint processing and ensuring continuous quality 
control. Or, in a contract electronics manufacturing 
scenario, a team of skilled operators may utilize multiple 
camera stations powered by Basler cameras and Alitheon 
technology to guide the correct assembly of circuit 
boards and modules. Later, in field service or aftermarket 
settings, the FeaturePrint ID originally generated onsite is 
available for product verification within a mobile app.

Title:  Device Temperature Feature 
available again  on ace U and 
ace L cameras  
Product Family:  ace U, ace L  
Release date:  February  22, 2022  
Update: J anuary  06, 2023 all changes 
marked red  
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
 
Due to  the tense  demand -supply -situation we decided to remove  a temperature 
sensor which faced a shortage from our ace U and ace L cameras  in Q3/2021 . We 
focused on delivering cameras and reduced the feature scope.  
The Device Temperature Feature  was of no use and the Temperature State 
Feature  was deactivated.  
 
For further information please  see the published PCN’s from our website:   
Device Temperature Feature removed Part 1  
Device Temperature Feature removed Part 2  
Device Temperature Feature removed Part 3  
 
Now the temperature sensor is available again and we  change all cameras listed 
in the above mentioned PCNs back  to the original feature scope.

The Device Temperature camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the cameras (see Basler Product Documentation ). The feature will 
return a correct value agai n and no longer the default value of 421°C.  
 
The Temperature State  camera feature  (see Basler Product Documentation ) 
indicates whether the cameras internal temperature is normal or too high.  In case of 
over temperature, the image acquisition is stopped and a test image appears until the 
camera has cooled down again.  This feature will be activated again and work as 
before .   
Firmware updates are not possible for cameras which were  produced without 
temperature sensor. With this product change a firmware update to future firmware 
versions will be possible again.

Title:  Barcode Change on Product 
Packages  
Product Family:  Basler cameras

Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
We as Basler see the traceability of our cameras as very important and equip our 
cameras  with a serial number on the camera itself and on the product outer package.  
The label on the camera outer  package lists the serial number in a barcode which is 
design ed and used especially for internal automated processes. Due to important 
internal system adaptions Basler needs to change the conte nt of the serial number 
barcode  shortly.  The following example shows a product package label with the 
affected barcode marke d red:  
  
We as Basler know about the importance of such an information and can imagine  that 
you as our customer process this information inside  your system as well.  Therefore, 
we would like to inform you herewith about this change and advise you to familiarize 
your scanning system with the new content . The change will take place s hort term 
beginning calendar week  3 in January 2023.

Release date:  February 2022  
Contact:     Basler Support 
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous     Firmware     PC Software 
 Product design   Process  
 
Reason for Change 
To offer an even higher value to our customers, new features were added to the ace 2 
firmware and power consumption has been reduced. Furthermore, the new firmware 
delivers maintenance work and corrects deviating camera behaviors. 
 
Change Description 
 
Basler has added valuable features to the ace 2 family which are available on all 
interfaces. 
For your convenience, the Device Link Speed  as well as the Effective Exposure 
Time might now be read out. Additionally, the Sensor State  of the camera can be 
configurated by choosing the values On, Off or Standby . With the camera feature 
Exposure Start Delay  you can determine the period of time between the detection of 
the trigger signal and the actual start of the exposure. 
Furthermore, the power consumption of all ace 2 cameras has been reduced. 
 
Features for selected models 
By activating the  Window Cropping Mode on Rolling Shutter Sensors IMX334 and 
IMX334ROI models the ace 2 camera allows higher framerates when the Region of 
Interest has been reduced. 
For all ace 2 Pro USB models it is now possible to read out the selected Power 
Source. 
We also included some maintenance work and fixed bugs. PRODUCT CHANGE NOTIFICATION

 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
The CoaXPress Premium Cables are subject of a mechanical design change. Reason 
are improvements of the longterm Basler supply chain from manufacturer to our 
customers with the focus on quality , stability and supply reliability . 
The compatibility of the cables with our CoaXPress cameras remain s the same.  
 
Change Description  
The main changes are:  
- the connector changes   
- the raw cable becomes thinner . Due to this, the minimum bending radius of the 
new cable design improves significantly.  
Currently, only the 3m and 5m version receive a design change. Longterm, also the 
10m Basler Premium CoaXPress Cable ( 2200000321 ) is expected to switch to  the 
new design. This will be published in a separate PCN.

Title:  New material codes for dart BCON for 
LVDS models / Development Kits  
Product Family:  dart BCON for LVDS, Development Kits

Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
 
Basler ’s embedded port folio exists  of camera modules and accompanying 
development kits. Up to  date the development kits have fallen under the product 
category  PowerPack s. In preparation for future portfolio extension s a new pr oduct 
category “Development Kits ” has now been created . As a consequence, the product 
type of the current development kits has changed accordingly.  
The dart BCON for LVDS is Basler’s first camera module with a low -level embedded 
interfac e. BCON is Basler’s proprietary interface technology for embedded systems. In 
preparation for future portfolio extensions based on BCON technology the material 
codes for all dart BCON for LVDS models have changed.  
 
Change Description  
 
In Basler’s material  codes the second last letter describes which interface the camera 
or camera module provides.   
Example:  daA1280 -54bm  
For all dart BCON for LVDS models this letter has now changed from b (BCON)  to l 
(LVDS).   
Example:  daA1280 -54lm  
Please find below a list of all dart BCON for LVDS models with new material codes.

Reason for Change  
 
Due to the ongoing component crisis, our supplier ADLINK has adapted the electrical 
design of the PCIe -GIE74.  
The standard functions of the interface card remain unchanged.  
If the ADLINK SDK is used for special functions, a new validation is recommended.  
Change Description  
 
The new design has replaced different power components, a micro controller and the 
PCIe switch. For normal use cases without using the ADLINK SDK for POE controlling 
the new version can be used.

Change Description 
In the design of the camera’s coreboard some improv ements were made. One change 
is implementing a new voltage regulation by changin g the input voltage and 
implementing a switch. Furthermore the layout was o ptimized. 
 
Reason for Change 
The change was originally made to reduce the power consumption of new high 
resolution and high speed camera models as for exam ple the acA2500-60um/uc.  
As these models and following camera models are sti ll under development, the mass 
production of these models will already start with the new coreboard.

CUSTOMER STORYAOI System with Frame Grabbers and FPGA 
Applet from Silicon Software 
Delvitech from Switzerland offers automatic optical inspection (AOI) to prevent process errors, increase the yield 
and reduce the costs in the manufacturing of assembled printed circuit boards (PCB). The core element of these 
systems is an optical head consisting of five cameras and various side-mounted illuminations. The company recently 
developed a new head upgrade for its AOI systems installed in the market, with more powerful cameras and frame 
grabbers – and is now benefiting of important sales, offering solutions significantly better with higher speed, 
improved detectability and greater flexibility. 
Delvitech needed new cameras for the optical head, as 
the existing ones lagged behind the desired high image 
quality. The cameras had to achieve a higher resolution, 
have suitable interfaces to the new frame grabbers and 
acquire at least 30 frames per second. For the scalability 
of the system, the interchangeability of cameras and 
frame grabbers was an important requirement, indepen -
dent of the camera interface and without changing the 
image processing software developed in-house. 
In the optical head there are a camera at the top and four 
cameras at the side together with 24 xenon light sources, 
4 RGB leds and a special sensor. A monochrome CMOS 
area scan camera 25 Mpixel with CoaXPress interface 
was selected for the upper camera instead of the pre -
vious 4 MP resolution camera. Four monochrome Camera 
Link Basler ace CMOS with 4 MP resolution and 180 
frames per second are now used for the side cameras 
replacing the previous analog ones. The upper camera 
has a larger sensor so that fine features can be better 
resolved or the same level of performance can be main -
tained at a higher throughput. Due to the also larger 
sensors of the side cameras, discrepancies in the resolu -
tion between all cameras are reduced. The selected 
cameras are dimensioned to run below their potential 
performance and therefore allow the performance of the 
system to be enhanced at a later stage. Scalability and Great Flexibility 
The disadvantage of the frame grabbers used so far was 
that they were only suitable for special cameras and were 
incompatible with the new high performance cameras 
selected, the intended light sources and the self-deve -
loped software based on algorithms with artificial intelli -
gence. Therefore Delvitech chose two different program -
mable frame grabbers from Silicon Software, both com -
patible with diverse cameras and lighting as well as the 
software. The upper camera, four side cameras and the 
lighting are synchronized by the microEnable 5 VCX-QP 
CoaXPress frame grabber, while the up to four side 
cameras are triggered by two Camera Link frame grab -
bers microEnable 5 VCL. With the system upgrade, Del -
vitech also switched to the very powerful 64bit D.ONE 
Core. 
The system was designed for scalability with the use of 
one standard camera up to five high-end cameras in the 
highest expansion stage, which the frame grabbers 
support. In order to connect them to the software, the 
project partners jointly developed image acquisition 
functions as a hardware applet using the FPGA develop -
ment environment VisualApplets from Silicon Software 
with the advantage that the frame grabbers, already 
during the image transfer, always generate the same 
output format. This means that the software can be easily 
further used when changing cameras, frame grabbers or 
the camera interface. The applet was designed as a data 
flow model and synthesized as FPGA code for the runtime 
environment on the frame grabber. The overall imple -
mentation of hardware, software and applet was com -
pleted within a few days. “We owe the short development 
time to Silicon Software‘s extraordinary consulting com -
petence and operational readiness. On the basis of only 
two coaching sessions the design-in could be completed 
entirely,” explains Roberto Gatti, VP Sales and Marketing 
of Delvitech.

High-Quality Software Included 
When inspecting assembled printed circuit boards, the 
AOI system on the one hand checks the presence, 
absence, the polarity, the names, the colors, the polari -
ties, and the correct positioning of the components. On 
the other hand, it inspects the shape of the solder joints 
by their form detecting opens, shorts, cold solder joints 
and any type of defects related to wrong solder joints on 
reflow and wave applications. For this purpose, a part of 
the printed circuit board is illuminated according to the 
specifications of the software using RGB led, whereupon 
one or more cameras trigger and take images with color 
reflection. This creates one or more images from different 
angles, whose colors are later reconstructed using the 
Delvitech software. The frame grabbers synchronize the 
triggering of the cameras and the numerous light sources 
via a flash controller. After image acquisition, the images 
are corrected by the software in the course of image pre -
processing, for example their orientation. The AOI image processing system with the optical head is 
used in production plants. Due to the now given higher 
camera resolution, it achieves significantly better measu -
rement results at four times the speed and higher frame 
rate. This means that considerably more examinations of 
printed circuit boards can be carried out per minute – at 
the same cost of the overall system. The system now pro -
cesses images in just half a second, from acquisition and 
image pre-processing to merging and comparing the 
images, analyzing them and outputting the results. “The 
components can be flexibly exchanged and scaled 
regardless of the camera model and interface, and the 
system can be easily adapted to new customer require -
ments thanks to the accompanying applet,” states Gatti. 
In order to meet these requirements in the future, an 
extension of the system to 3D inspection with stereo 
vision is planned, which would further optimize the 
system.

Title:  Temperature State Feature – 
Removed on certain ace U and ace 
L cameras (part 3)  
Product Family:  ace U and  ace L  with certain sensors  
Release date:  September  06, 2021 
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
The demand -supply -situation for semiconductor -related components has become 
increasingly tense  and it  is our utmost aim to provide our customers  with the most 
reliable and competitive lead times possible in this challenging environment .  
One component that faces a s hortage is a temperatu re sensor that is needed for the 
“Device Temperature  Feature ” and the “Temperature State Feature ”.  
Due to the shortage of the temperature sensor we will focus on delivering cameras 
and reduce the  feature scope . The “Device Temperature F eature ” won’t be of  use 
anymore and the “Temperature State Feature ” will be deactivated for the cameras 
listed below.   
We manage to stay within the UL certifications, but this means the cameras may only 
be operate d with a lens  or any other heat dissipating device . 
Once the demand -supply -situation  has relaxed, we plan to offer both feature s again. 
This will be published in another Product Change Notification.  
 
Affected cameras  (detailed list of models below):  
ace U GigE with the following sensors: Python 2000, Python 5000, IMX174, IMX249, 
IMX273, IMX287, IMX264, ICX618 Replacement  
 
ace U and ace L USB with the following sensors: Python 500, Python 1300, Python 
2000, Python 5000, IMX174, IMX249, IMX250, IMX252, IMX183, IMX304, IMX253,

Change Description  
 
The following Temperature R equirements  are specified in our Basler Product 
Documentation to operate the cameras listed below.  
Housing Temperature during operation  0-50 °C  
Housing Temperature according to UL  max. 70°C  
Ambient Temperature according to UL  max. 30°C  
UL test conditions : no lens attached to camera; no heat dissipation measures; 
ambient temperature kept at 30°C.  
 
The temperature limits will not change. However, to stay in accordance with UL  the 
test conditions were changed: cameras need to always be equipped with a lens . No 
camera exceeds the UL temperature limit of 70°C and all cameras will keep their UL 
certification.  
Please note that t o avoid burns or damaging the camera you must never use the 
camera without a lens  or alternative heat dissipation  to operate  the camera  
according to the specified maximum housing temperature of 50°C .  
 
 
The Device Temperature  camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the camera  (see Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below , the feature will still be accessible. However, 
because the se cameras will not be equipped with the temperature sensor, a  default  
value of 421°C  will be returned .

The Temperature State  camera feature indicates whether the camera's internal 
temperature is normal or too high.  In case of over temperature , the image acquisition 
is stopped and a  test image appears until the camera has cooled down again  (see 
Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below, the feature will be deactiva ted by removing the 
temperature thresholds. It will always return the parameter value “ok”.   
 
The over temperature threshold is for the following two purposes:  
1) Ensuring UL conformity of the camera .  
This requirement is still fulfilled as described  above.   
 
2) Preventing damage of the camera.   
At elevated temperatures, the camera may get damaged, the camera's lifetime is 
shortened, and image quality can degrade.  We therefore ask you to take special care 
to provide sufficient heat dissipation to maintain the temperat ure of the camera 
housing at 50 °C or less .  
 
If sufficient heat dissipation is provided in the application and cameras are operated 
according to the specified maximum housing temperature of 50°C , this product 
change does not have an impact on heat development within the camera.  
In case cameras in your application have switched to test images before (please see 
“Temperature State Feature” ), your application might exceed the specified operating 
temperature  and additional measures to provide sufficient heat dissipation might be 
needed. Please contact our Basle r Support team for assistance.  
If cameras in your  application haven’t switched  to test images before, the removed 
thresholds will have no  consequence.  
 
Please note that  you won’t be able to update future firmware versions on cameras that 
were produced  without the temperature sensor.

Reason for Change  
In order to serve  the high demand on our C23 5MP Premium Lens series we decided 
to accept slightly different mechanical parts on the outside of the lens. The 
appearance slightly differs, but this difference does not lead to any change in the 
usability or technical performance of the lens.  
Change Description  
 
The following picture shows the differences that can occur on this Lens s eries.  
Please be informed that both product designs can be delivered.  
 
 
- the silver ring is matt or shiny  
 
 
- the riffles of the adjustment rings are 
flat or deep

Title: Simplified licensing model of 
VisualApplets  
Product Family: VisualApplets 
Release date:  November 1st, 2022  
Contact:     Basler Support  
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous     Firmware     PC Software 
 Product design   Process  
 
Reason for Change 
 
To enhance VisualApplets for Basler customers, the VisualApplets licensing model will 
be simplified starting with VisualApplets version 3.3.2.  
 
Change Description 
 
Starting from November 1st 2022, all licenses for previous VisualApplets extensions, 
e.g., VisualApplets 3 Expert License, VisualApplets 3 Debugging License, 
VisualApplets 3 Parameters Translation License, VA3 LIB JPEG Compression 
License, VA3 LIB Segment./Classification License, will be discontinued.  
Instead, these licenses will be automatically included into the VisualApplets IDE 
License. 
The same change also affects all corresponding VisualApplets test licenses, which will 
be included into the VisualApplets IDE (Eval.) License. 
The changes will be effective with VisualApplets version 3.3.2 and will apply to all 
upcoming VisualApplets versions.

Title:  Device Temperature Feature – 
Removed on certain ace U and ace 
L cameras  
Product Family:  ace U and  ace L  with certain sensors  
Release date:  August 16, 2021 
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
The demand -supply -situation for semiconductor -related components has become 
increasingly tense  and it  is our utmost aim to provide our customers  with the most 
reliable and competitive lead times possible in this challenging environment .  
One component that faces a s hortage is a temperature sensor that is needed for the 
Device Temperature camera feature . This feature has never been officially supported 
and listed in our Basler Product Documentation for the cameras listed below. 
However, for the convenience of our customers it was available anyway.     
Due to the shortage of the temperature sensor we will focus on delivering cameras 
and go back to the officially stated feature scope . The Device Temperature camera 
feature won’t be of use  anymore for the cameras listed below.   
Once the demand -supply -situation has relaxed, we plan to offer the feature again. 
This will be published in another Product Change Notification.  
 
Affected cameras (detailed  list of models below):   
 ace L GigE  (IMX267, IMX304)  
 ace U USB (IMX226, IMX178)  
 ace U GigE (IMX226, IMX178)

Change Description  
 
The Device Temperature  camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the camera  (see Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below , the feature will still be accessible. However, 
because the se cameras will not be equipped with the temperature sensor, a  default  
value of 421°C  will be returned .   
 
The related  Temperature State  camera feature indicates whether the camera's 
internal temperature is normal or too high.  In case of over temperature , the image 
acquisition is stopped and a  test image appears until the camera has cooled down 
again.  
As stated in our Basler Product Documentation , the feature has never been supported 
by these cameras.  Nevertheless in pylon Viewer the feature has always shown the 
parameter value  “ok”, this will not change . 
   
This change does not have any impact on heat development within the cameras.

Title:  Firmware  Update For ace 2 
Cameras  
Product Family:  ace 2  
Release date:  June  17, 2020 (PM)  
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
There are two main reasons for this new firmware release:  
1. We fixed a b ug in our ace 2 models which mainly limited the possible speed 
increase for our Compression Beyond feature on ace 2 GigE cameras.  
2. We added a new High Speed Burst Mode, allowing the user to trigger a 
predefined burst of images at the maximum sensor speed possible in our 
hardware.  
 
Change Description  
1. Fixed Bug  
The fixed behavior of our camera now allows the user to achieve a factor two increase 
in speed on ace 2 Pro GigE cameras by using the Compression Beyond feature. The 
accurate increase heavily depends on the working point of the camera (pixel form at, 
ROI, etc.).  
2. New High Speed Burst Mode  
Usually, the frame rate of the camera is not only limited by its sensor and internal 
buffer, but also by its ability to transfer data. This includes, e.g., the interface 
bandwidth or your network setup.  
The High Speed burst mode allows you to work around these data transfer limitations 
and acquire a burst of images as quickly as possible.  PRODUCT CHANGE NOTIFICATION

To achieve this, during a burst, acquiring images and filling the camera's internal 
buffer is highly prioritized over transmitt ing data. Usually, images will be transmitted 
only after all images of a burst have been acquired. This may introduce a delay after 
each burst, i.e., lower the burst rate.

documentation .

Change Description  
Sequencer  
The Sequencer  camera feature  allows you to define sets of parameter settings, called 
sequencer sets, and apply them to a sequence of image acquisitions.  
As the camera acquires images, it applies one sequencer set after the other. This 
enables you to quickly change camera parameters without compromising the 
maximum frame rate.  
For further information about  this feature  please take a look at our product 
documentation  or contact the Basler Support.  
 
Static Defect Pixel Correction  
The Defect Pixel Correction  camera feature  allows you to minimize the influence of 
sensitivity differences of individual pixels of the sensor.  
In acquired images, some pixels may appear significantly brighter or darker than the 
rest, even if uniform light is used. This problem is caused by differences in sensitivity 
of the individual pixels which in turn are due to production tolerances.  
The Static Defect Pixel Correction is based on files that are stored on the camera and 
contain a list of defect pixel coordinates.  
The following defect pixel correction files can be stored on the camera:  
• Factory file: Contains the coordinates of defect pixels that were detected during 
camera production. With this file, the camera corrects pixels that have a 
significantly  lower  intensity value than the neighboring pixels, including 
completely black pixels.  
• User fil e: Contains user -defined coordinates. You can upload this file to the 
camera. This allows you to define new defect pixels that might have occurred  
over time, regardless of whether these pixels are too dark or too bright.  
For further information about this  feature  please take a look at our product 
documentation  or contact the Basler Support.

CUSTOMER STORYMulti-talented: Basler boost with Customized 
Interface Card in a Line Scan Application
Customer
 MJV-Sähkö Oy and Lateral Engine Oy
 Location:  Lahti, Finland and Espoo, Finland
 Industry: Factory Automation
 Implementation: 2019-2020
Application
MJV-Sähkö Oy delivers machine vision systems with 
parameterization capability for the sorting of plywood 
sheets for the plywood industry. In their automation pro -
jects such as veneer grading it is important to work with 
efficient, up-to-date automation systems to achieve high 
productivity. The veneer grading process often uses line 
scan cameras that require a complex installation process. 
This is why MJV-Sähkö Oy was looking for a color area 
scan camera that not only fulfils the requirements for the 
inspection process of the veneer grading, but can also be 
installed easily.Solution and Benefits
In the veneer sheet grading application, the sheets (e.g. 
1800 mm wide) are imaged on a conveyor using high-
resolution line scan imaging. Software analyzes the 
sheets using modern deep-learning techniques and the 
results can be used by the manufacturing system for 
various purposes such as separating the sheets into diffe -
rent grades or splicing the material.
“There is nothing revolutionary in line scan applications 
but the novelty at the core of this Customer Story is how 
we communicated with Basler to implement a Basler area 
scan camera for the imaging”, states Jaakko Rantala from 
Lateral Engine Oy. The basic idea is to configure the 
camera and the interface card so that the camera uses an 
AOI of only a few lines at a very high frame rate (e.g. 4 
lines @ 2000 Hz, triggered by an encoder interface). The 
chunks of grouped lines are then efficiently stitched 
together on the interface card side before transferring 
the complete frames to the host software.
This was made possible by following:
 High-resolution CMOS sensor of the Basler boost 
camera
 High bandwidth achieved by the CoaXPress 2.0 
interface (Basler boost camera + Basler CXP-12 
interface card)
 Most importantly: the excellent collaboration with 
Basler in which the interface card was upgraded to 
support new features. The features consist of the line 
stitching and an encoder interface for camera 
triggering.

Title:  Temperature State Feature – 
Removed on certain ace U and ace 
L cameras  
Product Family:  ace U and  ace L  with certain sensors  
Release date:  August 23, 2021 
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
The demand -supply -situation for semiconductor -related components has become 
increasingly tense  and it  is our utmost aim to provide our customers  with the most 
reliable and competitive lead times possible in this challenging environment .  
One component that faces a s hortage is a temperature sensor that is needed for the 
“Device Temperature  Feature ” and the “Temperature State Feature ”.  
Due to the shortage of the temperature sensor we will focus on delivering cameras 
and reduce the  feature scope . The “Device Temperature F eature ” won’t be of use  
anymore and the “Temperature State Feature ” will be deactivated for the cameras 
listed below.   
Once the demand -supply -situation  has relaxed, we plan to offer both feature s again. 
This will be published in another Product Change Notification.  
 
Affected cameras  (detailed list of models below):  
 
 ace U GigE with IMX183, IMX265, Python  300, Python 500 and Python  1300 
Sensor   
 ace U USB with IMX273 mono, IMX265 mono, IMX264 m ono, IMX287 and 
Python  300 Sensor  
 
Depending on the  stock situation we might expand this measure to further cameras 
models soon.

publish updates  later on our Website. Therefore please closely monitor th is Product 
Change Notification on our Website . All recent updates are marked in red.  
 
Change Description  
 
The following Temperature R equirements  are specified in our Basler Product 
Documentation to operate the cameras listed below. These Requirements are still 
valid and will not change.  
Housing Temperature during operation  0-50 °C  
Housing Temperature according to UL 60950 -1 max. 70°C  
Ambient Temperature according to UL 60950 -1 max. 30°C  
UL 60950 -1 test conditions: no lens attached to camera; no heat dissipation 
measures; ambient temperature kept at 30°C.  
 
The Device Temperature  camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the camera  (see Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below , the feature will  still be accessible. However, 
because the se cameras will not be equipped with the temperature sensor, a  default  
value of 421°C  will be returned .   
 
The Temperature State  camera feature indicates whether the camera's internal 
temperature is normal or too high.  In case of over temperature , the image acquisition 
is stopped and a  test image appears until the camera has cooled down again  (see 
Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below, the feature will be deactivated by removing the 
temperature thresholds. It will always return the parameter value “ok”.

The over temperature threshold used to serve two purposes:  
1) Ensuring UL conformity of the camera .  
This requirement is still fulfilled. The threshold is only removed from models that do 
not exceed the maximum 70°C Housing Temperature according to UL 60950 -1.  
 
2) Preventing damage of the camera.   
At elevated temperatures, the camera may get damaged, the camera's lifetime is 
shortened, and image quality can degrade.  We therefore ask you to take special care 
to provide sufficient heat dissipation to maintain the temperat ure of the camera 
housing at 50 °C or less .  
 
If sufficient heat dissipation is provided in the application and cameras are operated 
according to the specified maximum housing temperature of 50°C , this product 
change does not have an impact on heat development within the camera.  
In case cameras in your application have switched to test images before (please see 
“Temperature State Feature” ), your application might exceed the specified operating 
temperature  and additional measures to provide sufficient heat dissipation might be 
needed. Please contact our Basle r Support team for assistance.  
If cameras in your  application haven’t switched  to test images before, the removed 
thresholds will have no  consequence.  
 
Please note that  you won’t be able to update future firmware versions on cameras that 
were produced  without the temperature sensor.

Title:  Change of packaging and MOQ for all 
dart models  
Product Family:  dart (all models)  
Release date:  January 15 , 2018  
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
Due to persistent  problems in logistics, inventory management and release 
management caused by single dart orders associated  with loans  and general design 
sample  as well as  custom dart prototype distribution all dart models (dar t USB, dart 
BCON for LVDS) are  now shipped  in single packaged units.  
 
Change Description  
To date , the dart USB as well as the dart BCON for LVDS camera modules have been  
shipped in package units of 5 cameras. Also, the minimum order  quantity for all dart 
models has been  5 pieces . Starting from January 15th 2018   this will change and all 
dart models (dart USB, dart BCON for LVDS) will be shipped to customers in single 
packaged units . In a ddition to that the MOQ is reduced to 1 piece for all models.  
The changeover to individual packaging has no effect on the current list prices of the 
dart family (dart USB, dart BCON for LVDS). Also, w ith changing the  minimum order 
quantity, all customers are no longer obliged to order a multiple of 5 dart cameras.

Reason for Change 
To provide our customers the best possible images, we always think of new features 
that help customers to improve their machines and a pplications.

correction of edge shadowing when the image circle is too small in relation to the 
sensor size.

Change Description 
Vignetting is a well-known phenomenon in image proc essing and describes the 
decrease in image brightness towards the edge. This  often results in this effect: 
           
Fig. 1 Left without Vignetting Correction Feature, R ight with Vignetting Correction Feature 
Our Vignetting Correction feature corrects this eff ect and at the same time there is no 
negative effect on the frame rate or image quality after a one-time calibration of the 
camera, since the correction values are stored in t he camera and automatically taken 
into account in the image output. 
Please note that you have to use pylon 5.2.0 or hig her to use the Vignetting Feature. 
Further details about the feature behavior and the usage can be found on:

Title:  Exchange o f Getting Started 
Guide  
Product Family:  Ace 2  
Release date:  May 13, 2022 
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
We continuously optimize our products and processes. For this reason we decide d to 
optimize our Getting Started Guide.  The Getting Started Guide is a letter where we 
explain  how to get started with a camera . Until today it is  enclosed in every box within  
which  the camera is delivered.   
This change will lead to a better quality of information for our customers by using our 
online product documentation.  Furthermore, we avoid the usage of  unnecessary paper  
which is often discarded . This takes us one step closer to less paper consumption in 
terms of sustainability . 
Change Description  
 
The Getting Started Guide which is enclosed within the box  of each camera  will be 
exchanged by  an universal  product inlay card.

Change Description 
With revision 106202 – 17  the model acA1300-60gmNIR gets a new firmware vers ion.  
 
Reason for Change 
The firmware change was necessary to adapt the sens or behavior especially the 
saturation capacity due to production variation of the sensor manufacturer, but we 
make sure that it is within our camera test specifi cation.  
Due to production variation of the sensor manufactu rer – especially at the production 
of the silicon for sensors – it could came to minim al deviation of sensor behavior. This 
could appear at lower saturation capacity or bloomi ng effect at long exposure times 
and high gain on the other hand. 
Basler optimize this sensor behavior with the new f irmware to deliver the familiar 
quality at its best.

Title:  Basler SLP Controller now up to  
100ms pulse width  
Product Family:  Basler Lighting

Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
To provide our customers the best poss ible images, we continuously listen to the 
feedback of our customers  to improve their machines and applications.  
In particular, customers who use rolling shutter sensors and are already enthusiastic 
about the Basler SLP feature have asked for a longer pulse width of the SLP controlle r. 
Therefore, the Basler SLP Controller will now support a pulse width of 50µs up to 
100ms.  
We are very pleased that the new Basler SLP feature , which drives down the effort to 
integrate lightings in a vision system strongly , has been so well received from our 
customers.  
Further information about this feature can be found on:  
https://www.baslerweb.com/en/products/vision -components/basler -lighting/  
 
Change Description  
Basler SLP is an easy way to add lighting to a vision system.  
The Basler SLP camera feature enables the Basler SLP controller  to be used together 
with the all our popular ace U and ace L cameras . PRODUCT CHANGE NOTIFICATION

The feature enables the direct communication between the Basler SLP Controller and 
the camera, allowing the lighting to be easily operated in different modes such as 
continuous, strobe or overdrive.  
When using the Basler SLP Controller, the user can also b enefit from the compatibility 
with the Basler SLP feature and gain access to the simple lighting concept vi a a uniform 
software interface - Basler pylon Camera Software Suite . 
In addition users are given the freedom to choose from a variety of standard lig ht 
sources or use their own.  The solution is suitable for users with lighting experience who 
have applications with specific lighting requirements.  
Based on customer feedback, we have now extended the pulse width . Before this 
change a pulse width of  50µs up to 5 ms. Now each newly ordered Basler SLP Controller 
will support a pulse width of 50µs up to 100ms .  
We are happy that the Basler SLP Controller is now also the right choice for applications 
that require a longer pulse width.

Title:  Firmware Update on         
acA640 -121gm  
Product Family:  ace U 
Release date:  29.04. 2019  
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
To provide our customers the best possible  replacement camera for the discontinued 
CCD sensor ICX618 , Basler  developed and just recently launched  the acA640 -121gm .  
In some cases users experience d long times for opening the camera. This long 
opening times are caused by the poor performance of olde r GenICam versions in 
caching the more complex GenICam XML Files in current cameras.  
In order to resolve that issue a more recent GenICam version or a new camera 
firmware is required.   
With this firmware release the acA640 -121gm comes along with two different XML 
Files in order to allow the best performance in both cases.  
 
Further information about  Baslers unique 1:1 replacement camera  acA640 -121 can be 
found on:

Change Description  
With this firmware release of FW1.1 -0 the acA640 -121gm comes along with two 
different XML Files.  
Due to the explained intended use as a replacement camera  for older camera models , 
the XML File for an improved behavior with older SDK/GenICam versions is set by 
default.  
If customers want to use the fully equipped feature set (e.g. including USEM, 
Sequencer, PGI, etc.) and are using a new SDK/GenICam version, it is possible to 
switch the XML file.

Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
Due to ong oing optimizations and process  improvements we changed the IR cut f ilter 
and der f ilter holder (also know n as “passepartout ”) for dedicated  ace U models.  
Change Description  
 
Effected models:  
- ace U with Python  300, Python  500 and Python1300 Sensors 
- ace U with IMX252 and IMX265 Sensors  
Please see detailed list with a ffected camera models below.  
The following pictures show a n IMX265 Sensor, where the difference is visible. The 
passepartout appears  a little bit smaller than the old one  and reduces diffused light. 
The specification  of the IR- Cut filter and their transmission did not change.

CUSTOMER STORYAlitheon Software and Basler ace Give Identity 
to Components Without the Use of Labels or 
Markings
Customer
 Alitheon, Inc. 
 Location: Bellevue, Washington, USA
 Industry: Factory Automation / Industrial Software
 Implementation: 2020
Application
Each year, global manufacturers and their suppliers 
deliver increasingly sophisticated products to their  
customers. Advanced vehicles, electronics, and other 
engineered goods now reach their markets through a 
precise physical and digital orchestration, with every 
component playing a role for quality and performance. 
Products such as, fasteners, circuit boards, castings, and 
even textiles must now be “smart” – uniquely identified 
and individually traceable. Yet these high-volume parts 
often resist identification, their design incompatible with 
barcode labels, etchings, or packaging. Alitheon was 
founded to solve this problem with a universal traceabi -
lity model, providing item-level certainty without altering 
product designs or manufacturing processes. With just a 
camera in the factory or in the field, Alitheon technology 
verifies the identity of virtually any object using software 
algorithms.
Through contactless machine vision, Alitheon software 
analyses the surface of every unique product or part, 
generating a digital code that differentiates it from even 
millions of seemingly identical objects. This FeaturePrint™ 
ID represents an authoritative, virtual serial number that 
can be stored, checked, and rechecked over an object’s 
entire useful life. In factory settings, FeaturePrint soft -
ware retrofits existing production lines through conti -
nuous-duty industrial cameras. With automated optics 
and sensors in place, even decades-old factory sites can 
easily receive an all-new digital control system to track 
goods. FeaturePrint endpoints can be attached to 
machine cells or operator stations, verifying the  
production flow, and generating data for the enterprise. 
Once a FeaturePrint ID is captured, it is available via cloud 
systems to allow goods to be verified anywhere – in 
plants, distribution channels, or with end users using a mobile app. In order to allow clear identification, Alitheon 
searched for a camera with the ability to capture even the 
smallest details and often during fast moving production 
lines.
Solution and Benefits 
Alitheon specifies Basler products through its Feature -
Print Automate and Feature Print Station components. 
Deployed within a machine retrofit chassis or a benchtop 
form factor, Basler ace L and Classic cameras generate 
images that keep up with production lines. In an automo -
tive setting, a powertrain part may transform through 
automated stages including raw stock, machining, heat 
treating, and grinding. In this case, a Basler camera ope -
rates at each of these four steps, triggering Alitheon’s 
FeaturePrint processing and ensuring continuous quality 
control. Or, in a contract electronics manufacturing 
scenario, a team of skilled operators may utilize multiple 
camera stations powered by Basler cameras and Alitheon 
technology to guide the correct assembly of circuit 
boards and modules. Later, in field service or aftermarket 
settings, the FeaturePrint ID originally generated onsite is 
available for product verification within a mobile app.

 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
We continuously optimize our products and processes. For this reason we decide d to 
optimize our Getting Started Guide.  The Getting Started Guide is a letter where we 
explain  how to get started with a camera . Until today it is  enclosed in every box within  
which the camera is delivered.   
This change will lead to a better quality of information for our customers by using our 
online product documentation.  Furthermore, we avoid the usage of  unnecessary paper  
which is often discarded . This takes us one step closer to less paper consumption in 
terms of sustainability . 
Change Description  
 
The Getting Started Guide which is enclosed within the box  of each camera  will be 
exchanged by  an universal  product inlay card.

Reason for Change  
Due to the fact that our standa rd cables did not fit with our  previous  Basler GigE

old card were too close together, which is why the cables did not fit.

Title:  Device Temperature Feature 
available again  on ace U and

Release date:  February  22, 2022

Reason for Change  
 
Due to  the tense  demand -supply -situation we decided to remove  a temperature 
sensor which faced a shortage from our ace U and ace L cameras  in Q3/2021 . We 
focused on delivering cameras and reduced the feature scope.  
The Device Temperature Feature  was of no use and the Temperature State 
Feature  was deactivated.  
 
For further information please  see the published PCN’s from our website:   
Device Temperature Feature removed Part 1  
Device Temperature Feature removed Part 2  
Device Temperature Feature removed Part 3  
 
Now the temperature sensor is available again and we  change all cameras listed 
in the above mentioned PCNs back  to the original feature scope.

The Device Temperature camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the cameras (see Basler Product Documentation ). The feature will 
return a correct value agai n and no longer the default value of 421°C.  
 
The Temperature State  camera feature  (see Basler Product Documentation ) 
indicates whether the cameras internal temperature is normal or too high.  In case of 
over temperature, the image acquisition is stopped and a test image appears until the 
camera has cooled down again.  This feature will be activated again and work as 
before .   
Firmware updates are not possible for cameras which were  produced without 
temperature sensor. With this product change a firmware update to future firmware 
versions will be possible again.

Title:  Barcode Change on Product 
Packages  
Product Family:  Basler cameras

Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
We as Basler see the traceability of our cameras as very important and equip our 
cameras  with a serial number on the camera itself and on the product outer package.  
The label on the camera outer  package lists the serial number in a barcode which is 
design ed and used especially for internal automated processes. Due to important 
internal system adaptions Basler needs to change the conte nt of the serial number 
barcode  shortly.  The following example shows a product package label with the 
affected barcode marke d red:  
  
We as Basler know about the importance of such an information and can imagine  that 
you as our customer process this information inside  your system as well.  Therefore, 
we would like to inform you herewith about this change and advise you to familiarize 
your scanning system with the new content . The change will take place s hort term 
beginning calendar week  3 in January 2023.

Title: New Firmware Features on ace 2  
Product Family: ace 2 
Release date:  February 2022  
Contact:     Basler Support 
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous     Firmware     PC Software 
 Product design   Process  
 
Reason for Change 
To offer an even higher value to our customers, new features were added to the ace 2 
firmware and power consumption has been reduced. Furthermore, the new firmware 
delivers maintenance work and corrects deviating camera behaviors. 
 
Change Description 
 
Basler has added valuable features to the ace 2 family which are available on all 
interfaces. 
For your convenience, the Device Link Speed  as well as the Effective Exposure 
Time might now be read out. Additionally, the Sensor State  of the camera can be 
configurated by choosing the values On, Off or Standby . With the camera feature 
Exposure Start Delay  you can determine the period of time between the detection of 
the trigger signal and the actual start of the exposure. 
Furthermore, the power consumption of all ace 2 cameras has been reduced. 
 
Features for selected models 
By activating the  Window Cropping Mode on Rolling Shutter Sensors IMX334 and 
IMX334ROI models the ace 2 camera allows higher framerates when the Region of 
Interest has been reduced. 
For all ace 2 Pro USB models it is now possible to read out the selected Power 
Source. 
We also included some maintenance work and fixed bugs. PRODUCT CHANGE NOTIFICATION

 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
The CoaXPress Premium Cables are subject of a mechanical design change. Reason 
are improvements of the longterm Basler supply chain from manufacturer to our 
customers with the focus on quality , stability and supply reliability . 
The compatibility of the cables with our CoaXPress cameras remain s the same.  
 
Change Description  
The main changes are:  
- the connector changes   
- the raw cable becomes thinner . Due to this, the minimum bending radius of the 
new cable design improves significantly.  
Currently, only the 3m and 5m version receive a design change. Longterm, also the 
10m Basler Premium CoaXPress Cable ( 2200000321 ) is expected to switch to  the 
new design. This will be published in a separate PCN.

Title:  New material codes for dart BCON for 
LVDS models / Development Kits  
Product Family:  dart BCON for LVDS, Development Kits

Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
 
Basler ’s embedded port folio exists  of camera modules and accompanying 
development kits. Up to  date the development kits have fallen under the product 
category  PowerPack s. In preparation for future portfolio extension s a new pr oduct 
category “Development Kits ” has now been created . As a consequence, the product 
type of the current development kits has changed accordingly.  
The dart BCON for LVDS is Basler’s first camera module with a low -level embedded 
interfac e. BCON is Basler’s proprietary interface technology for embedded systems. In 
preparation for future portfolio extensions based on BCON technology the material 
codes for all dart BCON for LVDS models have changed.  
 
Change Description  
 
In Basler’s material  codes the second last letter describes which interface the camera 
or camera module provides.   
Example:  daA1280 -54bm  
For all dart BCON for LVDS models this letter has now changed from b (BCON)  to l 
(LVDS).   
Example:  daA1280 -54lm  
Please find below a list of all dart BCON for LVDS models with new material codes.

CUSTOMER STORYAOI System with Frame Grabbers and FPGA 
Applet from Silicon Software 
Delvitech from Switzerland offers automatic optical inspection (AOI) to prevent process errors, increase the yield 
and reduce the costs in the manufacturing of assembled printed circuit boards (PCB). The core element of these 
systems is an optical head consisting of five cameras and various side-mounted illuminations. The company recently 
developed a new head upgrade for its AOI systems installed in the market, with more powerful cameras and frame 
grabbers – and is now benefiting of important sales, offering solutions significantly better with higher speed, 
improved detectability and greater flexibility. 
Delvitech needed new cameras for the optical head, as 
the existing ones lagged behind the desired high image 
quality. The cameras had to achieve a higher resolution, 
have suitable interfaces to the new frame grabbers and 
acquire at least 30 frames per second. For the scalability 
of the system, the interchangeability of cameras and 
frame grabbers was an important requirement, indepen -
dent of the camera interface and without changing the 
image processing software developed in-house. 
In the optical head there are a camera at the top and four 
cameras at the side together with 24 xenon light sources, 
4 RGB leds and a special sensor. A monochrome CMOS 
area scan camera 25 Mpixel with CoaXPress interface 
was selected for the upper camera instead of the pre -
vious 4 MP resolution camera. Four monochrome Camera 
Link Basler ace CMOS with 4 MP resolution and 180 
frames per second are now used for the side cameras 
replacing the previous analog ones. The upper camera 
has a larger sensor so that fine features can be better 
resolved or the same level of performance can be main -
tained at a higher throughput. Due to the also larger 
sensors of the side cameras, discrepancies in the resolu -
tion between all cameras are reduced. The selected 
cameras are dimensioned to run below their potential 
performance and therefore allow the performance of the 
system to be enhanced at a later stage. Scalability and Great Flexibility 
The disadvantage of the frame grabbers used so far was 
that they were only suitable for special cameras and were 
incompatible with the new high performance cameras 
selected, the intended light sources and the self-deve -
loped software based on algorithms with artificial intelli -
gence. Therefore Delvitech chose two different program -
mable frame grabbers from Silicon Software, both com -
patible with diverse cameras and lighting as well as the 
software. The upper camera, four side cameras and the 
lighting are synchronized by the microEnable 5 VCX-QP 
CoaXPress frame grabber, while the up to four side 
cameras are triggered by two Camera Link frame grab -
bers microEnable 5 VCL. With the system upgrade, Del -
vitech also switched to the very powerful 64bit D.ONE 
Core. 
The system was designed for scalability with the use of 
one standard camera up to five high-end cameras in the 
highest expansion stage, which the frame grabbers 
support. In order to connect them to the software, the 
project partners jointly developed image acquisition 
functions as a hardware applet using the FPGA develop -
ment environment VisualApplets from Silicon Software 
with the advantage that the frame grabbers, already 
during the image transfer, always generate the same 
output format. This means that the software can be easily 
further used when changing cameras, frame grabbers or 
the camera interface. The applet was designed as a data 
flow model and synthesized as FPGA code for the runtime 
environment on the frame grabber. The overall imple -
mentation of hardware, software and applet was com -
pleted within a few days. “We owe the short development 
time to Silicon Software‘s extraordinary consulting com -
petence and operational readiness. On the basis of only 
two coaching sessions the design-in could be completed 
entirely,” explains Roberto Gatti, VP Sales and Marketing 
of Delvitech.

High-Quality Software Included 
When inspecting assembled printed circuit boards, the 
AOI system on the one hand checks the presence, 
absence, the polarity, the names, the colors, the polari -
ties, and the correct positioning of the components. On 
the other hand, it inspects the shape of the solder joints 
by their form detecting opens, shorts, cold solder joints 
and any type of defects related to wrong solder joints on 
reflow and wave applications. For this purpose, a part of 
the printed circuit board is illuminated according to the 
specifications of the software using RGB led, whereupon 
one or more cameras trigger and take images with color 
reflection. This creates one or more images from different 
angles, whose colors are later reconstructed using the 
Delvitech software. The frame grabbers synchronize the 
triggering of the cameras and the numerous light sources 
via a flash controller. After image acquisition, the images 
are corrected by the software in the course of image pre -
processing, for example their orientation. The AOI image processing system with the optical head is 
used in production plants. Due to the now given higher 
camera resolution, it achieves significantly better measu -
rement results at four times the speed and higher frame 
rate. This means that considerably more examinations of 
printed circuit boards can be carried out per minute – at 
the same cost of the overall system. The system now pro -
cesses images in just half a second, from acquisition and 
image pre-processing to merging and comparing the 
images, analyzing them and outputting the results. “The 
components can be flexibly exchanged and scaled 
regardless of the camera model and interface, and the 
system can be easily adapted to new customer require -
ments thanks to the accompanying applet,” states Gatti. 
In order to meet these requirements in the future, an 
extension of the system to 3D inspection with stereo 
vision is planned, which would further optimize the 
system.

Title:  Temperature State Feature – 
Removed on certain ace U and ace 
L cameras (part 3)  
Product Family:  ace U and  ace L  with certain sensors  
Release date:  September  06, 2021 
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
The demand -supply -situation for semiconductor -related components has become 
increasingly tense  and it  is our utmost aim to provide our customers  with the most 
reliable and competitive lead times possible in this challenging environment .  
One component that faces a s hortage is a temperatu re sensor that is needed for the 
“Device Temperature  Feature ” and the “Temperature State Feature ”.  
Due to the shortage of the temperature sensor we will focus on delivering cameras 
and reduce the  feature scope . The “Device Temperature F eature ” won’t be of  use 
anymore and the “Temperature State Feature ” will be deactivated for the cameras 
listed below.   
We manage to stay within the UL certifications, but this means the cameras may only 
be operate d with a lens  or any other heat dissipating device . 
Once the demand -supply -situation  has relaxed, we plan to offer both feature s again. 
This will be published in another Product Change Notification.  
 
Affected cameras  (detailed list of models below):  
ace U GigE with the following sensors: Python 2000, Python 5000, IMX174, IMX249, 
IMX273, IMX287, IMX264, ICX618 Replacement  
 
ace U and ace L USB with the following sensors: Python 500, Python 1300, Python 
2000, Python 5000, IMX174, IMX249, IMX250, IMX252, IMX183, IMX304, IMX253,

Change Description  
 
The following Temperature R equirements  are specified in our Basler Product 
Documentation to operate the cameras listed below.  
Housing Temperature during operation  0-50 °C  
Housing Temperature according to UL  max. 70°C  
Ambient Temperature according to UL  max. 30°C  
UL test conditions : no lens attached to camera; no heat dissipation measures; 
ambient temperature kept at 30°C.  
 
The temperature limits will not change. However, to stay in accordance with UL  the 
test conditions were changed: cameras need to always be equipped with a lens . No 
camera exceeds the UL temperature limit of 70°C and all cameras will keep their UL 
certification.  
Please note that t o avoid burns or damaging the camera you must never use the 
camera without a lens  or alternative heat dissipation  to operate  the camera  
according to the specified maximum housing temperature of 50°C .  
 
 
The Device Temperature  camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the camera  (see Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below , the feature will still be accessible. However, 
because the se cameras will not be equipped with the temperature sensor, a  default  
value of 421°C  will be returned .

The Temperature State  camera feature indicates whether the camera's internal 
temperature is normal or too high.  In case of over temperature , the image acquisition 
is stopped and a  test image appears until the camera has cooled down again  (see 
Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below, the feature will be deactiva ted by removing the 
temperature thresholds. It will always return the parameter value “ok”.   
 
The over temperature threshold is for the following two purposes:  
1) Ensuring UL conformity of the camera .  
This requirement is still fulfilled as described  above.   
 
2) Preventing damage of the camera.   
At elevated temperatures, the camera may get damaged, the camera's lifetime is 
shortened, and image quality can degrade.  We therefore ask you to take special care 
to provide sufficient heat dissipation to maintain the temperat ure of the camera 
housing at 50 °C or less .  
 
If sufficient heat dissipation is provided in the application and cameras are operated 
according to the specified maximum housing temperature of 50°C , this product 
change does not have an impact on heat development within the camera.  
In case cameras in your application have switched to test images before (please see 
“Temperature State Feature” ), your application might exceed the specified operating 
temperature  and additional measures to provide sufficient heat dissipation might be 
needed. Please contact our Basle r Support team for assistance.  
If cameras in your  application haven’t switched  to test images before, the removed 
thresholds will have no  consequence.  
 
Please note that  you won’t be able to update future firmware versions on cameras that 
were produced  without the temperature sensor.

Title: Simplified licensing model of 
VisualApplets  
Product Family: VisualApplets 
Release date:  November 1st, 2022  
Contact:     Basler Support  
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous     Firmware     PC Software 
 Product design   Process  
 
Reason for Change 
 
To enhance VisualApplets for Basler customers, the VisualApplets licensing model will 
be simplified starting with VisualApplets version 3.3.2.  
 
Change Description 
 
Starting from November 1st 2022, all licenses for previous VisualApplets extensions, 
e.g., VisualApplets 3 Expert License, VisualApplets 3 Debugging License, 
VisualApplets 3 Parameters Translation License, VA3 LIB JPEG Compression 
License, VA3 LIB Segment./Classification License, will be discontinued.  
Instead, these licenses will be automatically included into the VisualApplets IDE 
License. 
The same change also affects all corresponding VisualApplets test licenses, which will 
be included into the VisualApplets IDE (Eval.) License. 
The changes will be effective with VisualApplets version 3.3.2 and will apply to all 
upcoming VisualApplets versions.

Title:  Device Temperature Feature – 
Removed on certain ace U and ace 
L cameras  
Product Family:  ace U and  ace L  with certain sensors  
Release date:  August 16, 2021 
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
The demand -supply -situation for semiconductor -related components has become 
increasingly tense  and it  is our utmost aim to provide our customers  with the most 
reliable and competitive lead times possible in this challenging environment .  
One component that faces a s hortage is a temperature sensor that is needed for the 
Device Temperature camera feature . This feature has never been officially supported 
and listed in our Basler Product Documentation for the cameras listed below. 
However, for the convenience of our customers it was available anyway.     
Due to the shortage of the temperature sensor we will focus on delivering cameras 
and go back to the officially stated feature scope . The Device Temperature camera 
feature won’t be of use  anymore for the cameras listed below.   
Once the demand -supply -situation has relaxed, we plan to offer the feature again. 
This will be published in another Product Change Notification.  
 
Affected cameras (detailed  list of models below):   
 ace L GigE  (IMX267, IMX304)  
 ace U USB (IMX226, IMX178)  
 ace U GigE (IMX226, IMX178)

Change Description  
 
The Device Temperature  camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the camera  (see Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below , the feature will still be accessible. However, 
because the se cameras will not be equipped with the temperature sensor, a  default  
value of 421°C  will be returned .   
 
The related  Temperature State  camera feature indicates whether the camera's 
internal temperature is normal or too high.  In case of over temperature , the image 
acquisition is stopped and a  test image appears until the camera has cooled down 
again.  
As stated in our Basler Product Documentation , the feature has never been supported 
by these cameras.  Nevertheless in pylon Viewer the feature has always shown the 
parameter value  “ok”, this will not change . 
   
This change does not have any impact on heat development within the cameras.

Title:  Firmware  Update For ace 2 
Cameras  
Product Family:  ace 2  
Release date:  June  17, 2020 (PM)  
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
There are two main reasons for this new firmware release:  
1. We fixed a b ug in our ace 2 models which mainly limited the possible speed 
increase for our Compression Beyond feature on ace 2 GigE cameras.  
2. We added a new High Speed Burst Mode, allowing the user to trigger a 
predefined burst of images at the maximum sensor speed possible in our 
hardware.  
 
Change Description  
1. Fixed Bug  
The fixed behavior of our camera now allows the user to achieve a factor two increase 
in speed on ace 2 Pro GigE cameras by using the Compression Beyond feature. The 
accurate increase heavily depends on the working point of the camera (pixel form at, 
ROI, etc.).  
2. New High Speed Burst Mode  
Usually, the frame rate of the camera is not only limited by its sensor and internal 
buffer, but also by its ability to transfer data. This includes, e.g., the interface 
bandwidth or your network setup.  
The High Speed burst mode allows you to work around these data transfer limitations 
and acquire a burst of images as quickly as possible.  PRODUCT CHANGE NOTIFICATION

To achieve this, during a burst, acquiring images and filling the camera's internal 
buffer is highly prioritized over transmitt ing data. Usually, images will be transmitted 
only after all images of a burst have been acquired. This may introduce a delay after 
each burst, i.e., lower the burst rate.  
For further information  on this new feature , please take a look at our product 
documentation .

Change Description  
Sequencer  
The Sequencer  camera feature  allows you to define sets of parameter settings, called 
sequencer sets, and apply them to a sequence of image acquisitions.  
As the camera acquires images, it applies one sequencer set after the other. This 
enables you to quickly change camera parameters without compromising the 
maximum frame rate.  
For further information about  this feature  please take a look at our product 
documentation  or contact the Basler Support.  
 
Static Defect Pixel Correction  
The Defect Pixel Correction  camera feature  allows you to minimize the influence of 
sensitivity differences of individual pixels of the sensor.  
In acquired images, some pixels may appear significantly brighter or darker than the 
rest, even if uniform light is used. This problem is caused by differences in sensitivity 
of the individual pixels which in turn are due to production tolerances.  
The Static Defect Pixel Correction is based on files that are stored on the camera and 
contain a list of defect pixel coordinates.  
The following defect pixel correction files can be stored on the camera:  
• Factory file: Contains the coordinates of defect pixels that were detected during 
camera production. With this file, the camera corrects pixels that have a 
significantly  lower  intensity value than the neighboring pixels, including 
completely black pixels.  
• User fil e: Contains user -defined coordinates. You can upload this file to the 
camera. This allows you to define new defect pixels that might have occurred  
over time, regardless of whether these pixels are too dark or too bright.  
For further information about this  feature  please take a look at our product 
documentation  or contact the Basler Support.

CUSTOMER STORYMulti-talented: Basler boost with Customized 
Interface Card in a Line Scan Application
Customer
 MJV-Sähkö Oy and Lateral Engine Oy
 Location:  Lahti, Finland and Espoo, Finland
 Industry: Factory Automation
 Implementation: 2019-2020
Application
MJV-Sähkö Oy delivers machine vision systems with 
parameterization capability for the sorting of plywood 
sheets for the plywood industry. In their automation pro -
jects such as veneer grading it is important to work with 
efficient, up-to-date automation systems to achieve high 
productivity. The veneer grading process often uses line 
scan cameras that require a complex installation process. 
This is why MJV-Sähkö Oy was looking for a color area 
scan camera that not only fulfils the requirements for the 
inspection process of the veneer grading, but can also be 
installed easily.Solution and Benefits
In the veneer sheet grading application, the sheets (e.g. 
1800 mm wide) are imaged on a conveyor using high-
resolution line scan imaging. Software analyzes the 
sheets using modern deep-learning techniques and the 
results can be used by the manufacturing system for 
various purposes such as separating the sheets into diffe -
rent grades or splicing the material.
“There is nothing revolutionary in line scan applications 
but the novelty at the core of this Customer Story is how 
we communicated with Basler to implement a Basler area 
scan camera for the imaging”, states Jaakko Rantala from 
Lateral Engine Oy. The basic idea is to configure the 
camera and the interface card so that the camera uses an 
AOI of only a few lines at a very high frame rate (e.g. 4 
lines @ 2000 Hz, triggered by an encoder interface). The 
chunks of grouped lines are then efficiently stitched 
together on the interface card side before transferring 
the complete frames to the host software.
This was made possible by following:
 High-resolution CMOS sensor of the Basler boost 
camera
 High bandwidth achieved by the CoaXPress 2.0 
interface (Basler boost camera + Basler CXP-12 
interface card)
 Most importantly: the excellent collaboration with 
Basler in which the interface card was upgraded to 
support new features. The features consist of the line 
stitching and an encoder interface for camera 
triggering.

Title:  Temperature State Feature – 
Removed on certain ace U and ace 
L cameras  
Product Family:  ace U and  ace L  with certain sensors  
Release date:  August 23, 2021 
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
The demand -supply -situation for semiconductor -related components has become 
increasingly tense  and it  is our utmost aim to provide our customers  with the most 
reliable and competitive lead times possible in this challenging environment .  
One component that faces a s hortage is a temperature sensor that is needed for the 
“Device Temperature  Feature ” and the “Temperature State Feature ”.  
Due to the shortage of the temperature sensor we will focus on delivering cameras 
and reduce the  feature scope . The “Device Temperature F eature ” won’t be of use  
anymore and the “Temperature State Feature ” will be deactivated for the cameras 
listed below.   
Once the demand -supply -situation  has relaxed, we plan to offer both feature s again. 
This will be published in another Product Change Notification.  
 
Affected cameras  (detailed list of models below):  
 
 ace U GigE with IMX183, IMX265, Python  300, Python 500 and Python  1300 
Sensor   
 ace U USB with IMX273 mono, IMX265 mono, IMX264 m ono, IMX287 and 
Python  300 Sensor  
 
Depending on the  stock situation we might expand this measure to further cameras 
models soon.

We share this  initial version of the Product Change Notification by email once and 
publish updates  later on our Website. Therefore please closely monitor th is Product 
Change Notification on our Website . All recent updates are marked in red.  
 
Change Description  
 
The following Temperature R equirements  are specified in our Basler Product 
Documentation to operate the cameras listed below. These Requirements are still 
valid and will not change.  
Housing Temperature during operation  0-50 °C  
Housing Temperature according to UL 60950 -1 max. 70°C  
Ambient Temperature according to UL 60950 -1 max. 30°C  
UL 60950 -1 test conditions: no lens attached to camera; no heat dissipation 
measures; ambient temperature kept at 30°C.  
 
The Device Temperature  camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the camera  (see Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below , the feature will  still be accessible. However, 
because the se cameras will not be equipped with the temperature sensor, a  default  
value of 421°C  will be returned .   
 
The Temperature State  camera feature indicates whether the camera's internal 
temperature is normal or too high.  In case of over temperature , the image acquisition 
is stopped and a  test image appears until the camera has cooled down again  (see 
Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below, the feature will be deactivated by removing the 
temperature thresholds. It will always return the parameter value “ok”.

The over temperature threshold used to serve two purposes:  
1) Ensuring UL conformity of the camera .  
This requirement is still fulfilled. The threshold is only removed from models that do 
not exceed the maximum 70°C Housing Temperature according to UL 60950 -1.  
 
2) Preventing damage of the camera.   
At elevated temperatures, the camera may get damaged, the camera's lifetime is 
shortened, and image quality can degrade.  We therefore ask you to take special care 
to provide sufficient heat dissipation to maintain the temperat ure of the camera 
housing at 50 °C or less .  
 
If sufficient heat dissipation is provided in the application and cameras are operated 
according to the specified maximum housing temperature of 50°C , this product 
change does not have an impact on heat development within the camera.  
In case cameras in your application have switched to test images before (please see 
“Temperature State Feature” ), your application might exceed the specified operating 
temperature  and additional measures to provide sufficient heat dissipation might be 
needed. Please contact our Basle r Support team for assistance.  
If cameras in your  application haven’t switched  to test images before, the removed 
thresholds will have no  consequence.  
 
Please note that  you won’t be able to update future firmware versions on cameras that 
were produced  without the temperature sensor.

Fig. 1 Left without Vignetting Correction Feature, R ight with Vignetting Correction Feature 
Our Vignetting Correction feature corrects this eff ect and at the same time there is no 
negative effect on the frame rate or image quality after a one-time calibration of the 
camera, since the correction values are stored in t he camera and automatically taken 
into account in the image output. 
Please note that you have to use pylon 5.2.0 or hig her to use the Vignetting Feature. 
Further details about the feature behavior and the usage can be found on:

Reason for Change  
We continuously optimize our products and processes. For this reason we decide d to 
optimize our Getting Started Guide.  The Getting Started Guide is a letter where we 
explain  how to get started with a camera . Until today it is  enclosed in every box within  
which  the camera is delivered.   
This change will lead to a better quality of information for our customers by using our 
online product documentation.  Furthermore, we avoid the usage of  unnecessary paper  
which is often discarded . This takes us one step closer to less paper consumption in 
terms of sustainability . 
Change Description  
 
The Getting Started Guide which is enclosed within the box  of each camera  will be 
exchanged by  an universal  product inlay card.

Change Description 
With revision 106202 – 17  the model acA1300-60gmNIR gets a new firmware vers ion.  
 
Reason for Change 
The firmware change was necessary to adapt the sens or behavior especially the 
saturation capacity due to production variation of the sensor manufacturer, but we 
make sure that it is within our camera test specifi cation.  
Due to production variation of the sensor manufactu rer – especially at the production 
of the silicon for sensors – it could came to minim al deviation of sensor behavior. This 
could appear at lower saturation capacity or bloomi ng effect at long exposure times 
and high gain on the other hand. 
Basler optimize this sensor behavior with the new f irmware to deliver the familiar 
quality at its best.

Title:  Basler SLP Controller now up to  
100ms pulse width  
Product Family:  Basler Lighting  
Release date:  27 November , 2020 
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
To provide our customers the best poss ible images, we continuously listen to the 
feedback of our customers  to improve their machines and applications.  
In particular, customers who use rolling shutter sensors and are already enthusiastic 
about the Basler SLP feature have asked for a longer pulse width of the SLP controlle r. 
Therefore, the Basler SLP Controller will now support a pulse width of 50µs up to 
100ms.  
We are very pleased that the new Basler SLP feature , which drives down the effort to 
integrate lightings in a vision system strongly , has been so well received from our 
customers.  
Further information about this feature can be found on:  
https://www.baslerweb.com/en/products/vision -components/basler -lighting/  
 
Change Description  
Basler SLP is an easy way to add lighting to a vision system.  
The Basler SLP camera feature enables the Basler SLP controller  to be used together 
with the all our popular ace U and ace L cameras . PRODUCT CHANGE NOTIFICATION

The feature enables the direct communication between the Basler SLP Controller and 
the camera, allowing the lighting to be easily operated in different modes such as 
continuous, strobe or overdrive.  
When using the Basler SLP Controller, the user can also b enefit from the compatibility 
with the Basler SLP feature and gain access to the simple lighting concept vi a a uniform 
software interface - Basler pylon Camera Software Suite . 
In addition users are given the freedom to choose from a variety of standard lig ht 
sources or use their own.  The solution is suitable for users with lighting experience who 
have applications with specific lighting requirements.  
Based on customer feedback, we have now extended the pulse width . Before this 
change a pulse width of  50µs up to 5 ms. Now each newly ordered Basler SLP Controller 
will support a pulse width of 50µs up to 100ms .  
We are happy that the Basler SLP Controller is now also the right choice for applications 
that require a longer pulse width.

Reason for Change  
The CXP -12 product bundles were offered with the introduction of the boost camera 
series and interface card series . The successful expansion of both co mponent series 
also entailed the expansion of the bundle offering. In order to continue to implement 
and offer new requirements f or product combinations, bundle offers  will be stopp ed in 
favor of ordering individual components. This will make the ordering process more 
flexible and convenient.  The PCN describes the change in the product range and 
orderin g process.  
 
Change Description  
CXP-12 product bundles are no longer offered and can be replic ated by ordering the 
respective individual components, consisting of a boost camera model and an 
Interface Card IC -1C. 
Important : The individual components boost CXP-12 camera s and CXP-12 Interface 
Cards are still available and remain technically unchanged.

Title:  Firmware Update on         
acA640 -121gm  
Product Family:  ace U 
Release date:  29.04. 2019  
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
To provide our customers the best possible  replacement camera for the discontinued 
CCD sensor ICX618 , Basler  developed and just recently launched  the acA640 -121gm .  
In some cases users experience d long times for opening the camera. This long 
opening times are caused by the poor performance of olde r GenICam versions in 
caching the more complex GenICam XML Files in current cameras.  
In order to resolve that issue a more recent GenICam version or a new camera 
firmware is required.   
With this firmware release the acA640 -121gm comes along with two different XML 
Files in order to allow the best performance in both cases.  
 
Further information about  Baslers unique 1:1 replacement camera  acA640 -121 can be 
found on:

Change Description  
With this firmware release of FW1.1 -0 the acA640 -121gm comes along with two 
different XML Files.  
Due to the explained intended use as a replacement camera  for older camera models , 
the XML File for an improved behavior with older SDK/GenICam versions is set by 
default.  
If customers want to use the fully equipped feature set (e.g. including USEM, 
Sequencer, PGI, etc.) and are using a new SDK/GenICam version, it is possible to 
switch the XML file.

Reason for Change  
We optimized the mechanical design of the C23 5MP lens series to improve the 
adjustability and overall accuracy of the aperture. Due to this optimization the min F -
number  of the C23 5MP 16mm and 35mm lenses had to be changed.  
 
Change Description  
The minimum F-number ha d to be changed from f/1.8 to f/ 2.0. This was necessary 
due to overlapping tolerances. This should not be noticed in most applications and we 
don’t expect any impact on your system.  
Please note that the n aming has  change d too (see list below).

Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
Due to ong oing optimizations and process  improvements we changed the IR cut f ilter 
and der f ilter holder (also know n as “passepartout ”) for dedicated  ace U models.  
Change Description  
 
Effected models:  
- ace U with Python  300, Python  500 and Python1300 Sensors 
- ace U with IMX252 and IMX265 Sensors  
Please see detailed list with a ffected camera models below.  
The following pictures show a n IMX265 Sensor, where the difference is visible. The 
passepartout appears  a little bit smaller than the old one  and reduces diffused light. 
The specification  of the IR- Cut filter and their transmission did not change.

CUSTOMER STORYAlitheon Software and Basler ace Give Identity 
to Components Without the Use of Labels or 
Markings
Customer
 Alitheon, Inc. 
 Location: Bellevue, Washington, USA
 Industry: Factory Automation / Industrial Software
 Implementation: 2020
Application
Each year, global manufacturers and their suppliers 
deliver increasingly sophisticated products to their  
customers. Advanced vehicles, electronics, and other 
engineered goods now reach their markets through a 
precise physical and digital orchestration, with every 
component playing a role for quality and performance. 
Products such as, fasteners, circuit boards, castings, and 
even textiles must now be “smart” – uniquely identified 
and individually traceable. Yet these high-volume parts 
often resist identification, their design incompatible with 
barcode labels, etchings, or packaging. Alitheon was 
founded to solve this problem with a universal traceabi -
lity model, providing item-level certainty without altering 
product designs or manufacturing processes. With just a 
camera in the factory or in the field, Alitheon technology 
verifies the identity of virtually any object using software 
algorithms.
Through contactless machine vision, Alitheon software 
analyses the surface of every unique product or part, 
generating a digital code that differentiates it from even 
millions of seemingly identical objects. This FeaturePrint™ 
ID represents an authoritative, virtual serial number that 
can be stored, checked, and rechecked over an object’s 
entire useful life. In factory settings, FeaturePrint soft -
ware retrofits existing production lines through conti -
nuous-duty industrial cameras. With automated optics 
and sensors in place, even decades-old factory sites can 
easily receive an all-new digital control system to track 
goods. FeaturePrint endpoints can be attached to 
machine cells or operator stations, verifying the  
production flow, and generating data for the enterprise. 
Once a FeaturePrint ID is captured, it is available via cloud 
systems to allow goods to be verified anywhere – in 
plants, distribution channels, or with end users using a mobile app. In order to allow clear identification, Alitheon 
searched for a camera with the ability to capture even the 
smallest details and often during fast moving production 
lines.
Solution and Benefits 
Alitheon specifies Basler products through its Feature -
Print Automate and Feature Print Station components. 
Deployed within a machine retrofit chassis or a benchtop 
form factor, Basler ace L and Classic cameras generate 
images that keep up with production lines. In an automo -
tive setting, a powertrain part may transform through 
automated stages including raw stock, machining, heat 
treating, and grinding. In this case, a Basler camera ope -
rates at each of these four steps, triggering Alitheon’s 
FeaturePrint processing and ensuring continuous quality 
control. Or, in a contract electronics manufacturing 
scenario, a team of skilled operators may utilize multiple 
camera stations powered by Basler cameras and Alitheon 
technology to guide the correct assembly of circuit 
boards and modules. Later, in field service or aftermarket 
settings, the FeaturePrint ID originally generated onsite is 
available for product verification within a mobile app.

which the camera is delivered.   
This change will lead to a better quality of information for our customers by using our 
online product documentation.  Furthermore, we avoid the usage of  unnecessary paper  
which is often discarded . This takes us one step closer to less paper consumption in 
terms of sustainability .

Reason for Change  
Due to the fact that our standa rd cables did not fit with our  previous  Basler GigE 
Interface C ard, 4 port, a new card was added to the portfolio instead.  The ports of the 
old card were too close together, which is why the cables did not fit.  
Change Description  
There are no technical or quality changes. The only change is the design of the card 
(see imag e below )

Reason for Change  
 
Due to  the tense  demand -supply -situation we decided to remove  a temperature 
sensor which faced a shortage from our ace U and ace L cameras  in Q3/2021 . We 
focused on delivering cameras and reduced the feature scope.  
The Device Temperature Feature  was of no use and the Temperature State 
Feature  was deactivated.  
 
For further information please  see the published PCN’s from our website:   
Device Temperature Feature removed Part 1  
Device Temperature Feature removed Part 2  
Device Temperature Feature removed Part 3  
 
Now the temperature sensor is available again and we  change all cameras listed 
in the above mentioned PCNs back  to the original feature scope.

The Device Temperature camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the cameras (see Basler Product Documentation ). The feature will 
return a correct value agai n and no longer the default value of 421°C.  
 
The Temperature State  camera feature  (see Basler Product Documentation ) 
indicates whether the cameras internal temperature is normal or too high.  In case of 
over temperature, the image acquisition is stopped and a test image appears until the 
camera has cooled down again.  This feature will be activated again and work as 
before .   
Firmware updates are not possible for cameras which were  produced without 
temperature sensor. With this product change a firmware update to future firmware 
versions will be possible again.

Title:  Barcode Change on Product 
Packages  
Product Family:  Basler cameras   
Release date:  January  17th, 2023 
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
We as Basler see the traceability of our cameras as very important and equip our 
cameras  with a serial number on the camera itself and on the product outer package.  
The label on the camera outer  package lists the serial number in a barcode which is 
design ed and used especially for internal automated processes. Due to important 
internal system adaptions Basler needs to change the conte nt of the serial number 
barcode  shortly.  The following example shows a product package label with the 
affected barcode marke d red:  
  
We as Basler know about the importance of such an information and can imagine  that 
you as our customer process this information inside  your system as well.  Therefore, 
we would like to inform you herewith about this change and advise you to familiarize 
your scanning system with the new content . The change will take place s hort term 
beginning calendar week  3 in January 2023.

 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
The CoaXPress Premium Cables are subject of a mechanical design change. Reason

customers with the focus on quality , stability and supply reliability . 
The compatibility of the cables with our CoaXPress cameras remain s the same.  
 
Change Description  
The main changes are:  
- the connector changes   
- the raw cable becomes thinner . Due to this, the minimum bending radius of the 
new cable design improves significantly.  
Currently, only the 3m and 5m version receive a design change. Longterm, also the 
10m Basler Premium CoaXPress Cable ( 2200000321 ) is expected to switch to  the 
new design. This will be published in a separate PCN.

Title:  New material codes for dart BCON for 
LVDS models / Development Kits  
Product Family:  dart BCON for LVDS, Development Kits  
Release date:  January 25 , 2018  
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
 
Basler ’s embedded port folio exists  of camera modules and accompanying 
development kits. Up to  date the development kits have fallen under the product 
category  PowerPack s. In preparation for future portfolio extension s a new pr oduct 
category “Development Kits ” has now been created . As a consequence, the product 
type of the current development kits has changed accordingly.  
The dart BCON for LVDS is Basler’s first camera module with a low -level embedded 
interfac e. BCON is Basler’s proprietary interface technology for embedded systems. In 
preparation for future portfolio extensions based on BCON technology the material 
codes for all dart BCON for LVDS models have changed.  
 
Change Description  
 
In Basler’s material  codes the second last letter describes which interface the camera 
or camera module provides.   
Example:  daA1280 -54bm  
For all dart BCON for LVDS models this letter has now changed from b (BCON)  to l 
(LVDS).   
Example:  daA1280 -54lm  
Please find below a list of all dart BCON for LVDS models with new material codes.

Reason for Change  
 
Due to the ongoing component crisis, our supplier ADLINK has adapted the electrical

The standard functions of the interface card remain unchanged.  
If the ADLINK SDK is used for special functions, a new validation is recommended.  
Change Description  
 
The new design has replaced different power components, a micro controller and the 
PCIe switch. For normal use cases without using the ADLINK SDK for POE controlling 
the new version can be used.

Change Description 
In the design of the camera’s coreboard some improv ements were made. One change 
is implementing a new voltage regulation by changin g the input voltage and 
implementing a switch. Furthermore the layout was o ptimized. 
 
Reason for Change 
The change was originally made to reduce the power consumption of new high 
resolution and high speed camera models as for exam ple the acA2500-60um/uc.  
As these models and following camera models are sti ll under development, the mass 
production of these models will already start with the new coreboard.

 For the cameras listed in this Product Change Notif ication the new coreboard was 
implemented as well to benefit from the stated impr ovements.  
The exact power reduction is depending on your appl ication and setup of the camera 
as well as other conditions as ambient temperature etc. In the following table you see 
one exemplary measurement that was done with an acA 1920-155uc with the full AOI.

Reason for Change 
To provide our customers the best color images we a lways try to improve our 
cameras. In this case we changed the color presets in the color matrix that are 
measured in our laboratories with exemplary light s ettings to reduce the color error. 
 
Change Description 
By changing the values in the color matrix it was p ossible to reduce the color error 
DeltaE00 from 6.13 to 2.37. This results in better colors if you compare them on the 
color checker.

CUSTOMER STORYAOI System with Frame Grabbers and FPGA 
Applet from Silicon Software 
Delvitech from Switzerland offers automatic optical inspection (AOI) to prevent process errors, increase the yield 
and reduce the costs in the manufacturing of assembled printed circuit boards (PCB). The core element of these 
systems is an optical head consisting of five cameras and various side-mounted illuminations. The company recently 
developed a new head upgrade for its AOI systems installed in the market, with more powerful cameras and frame 
grabbers – and is now benefiting of important sales, offering solutions significantly better with higher speed, 
improved detectability and greater flexibility. 
Delvitech needed new cameras for the optical head, as 
the existing ones lagged behind the desired high image 
quality. The cameras had to achieve a higher resolution, 
have suitable interfaces to the new frame grabbers and 
acquire at least 30 frames per second. For the scalability 
of the system, the interchangeability of cameras and 
frame grabbers was an important requirement, indepen -
dent of the camera interface and without changing the 
image processing software developed in-house. 
In the optical head there are a camera at the top and four 
cameras at the side together with 24 xenon light sources, 
4 RGB leds and a special sensor. A monochrome CMOS 
area scan camera 25 Mpixel with CoaXPress interface 
was selected for the upper camera instead of the pre -
vious 4 MP resolution camera. Four monochrome Camera 
Link Basler ace CMOS with 4 MP resolution and 180 
frames per second are now used for the side cameras 
replacing the previous analog ones. The upper camera 
has a larger sensor so that fine features can be better 
resolved or the same level of performance can be main -
tained at a higher throughput. Due to the also larger 
sensors of the side cameras, discrepancies in the resolu -
tion between all cameras are reduced. The selected 
cameras are dimensioned to run below their potential 
performance and therefore allow the performance of the 
system to be enhanced at a later stage. Scalability and Great Flexibility 
The disadvantage of the frame grabbers used so far was 
that they were only suitable for special cameras and were 
incompatible with the new high performance cameras 
selected, the intended light sources and the self-deve -
loped software based on algorithms with artificial intelli -
gence. Therefore Delvitech chose two different program -
mable frame grabbers from Silicon Software, both com -
patible with diverse cameras and lighting as well as the 
software. The upper camera, four side cameras and the 
lighting are synchronized by the microEnable 5 VCX-QP 
CoaXPress frame grabber, while the up to four side 
cameras are triggered by two Camera Link frame grab -
bers microEnable 5 VCL. With the system upgrade, Del -
vitech also switched to the very powerful 64bit D.ONE 
Core. 
The system was designed for scalability with the use of 
one standard camera up to five high-end cameras in the 
highest expansion stage, which the frame grabbers 
support. In order to connect them to the software, the 
project partners jointly developed image acquisition 
functions as a hardware applet using the FPGA develop -
ment environment VisualApplets from Silicon Software 
with the advantage that the frame grabbers, already 
during the image transfer, always generate the same 
output format. This means that the software can be easily 
further used when changing cameras, frame grabbers or 
the camera interface. The applet was designed as a data 
flow model and synthesized as FPGA code for the runtime 
environment on the frame grabber. The overall imple -
mentation of hardware, software and applet was com -
pleted within a few days. “We owe the short development 
time to Silicon Software‘s extraordinary consulting com -
petence and operational readiness. On the basis of only 
two coaching sessions the design-in could be completed 
entirely,” explains Roberto Gatti, VP Sales and Marketing 
of Delvitech.

High-Quality Software Included 
When inspecting assembled printed circuit boards, the 
AOI system on the one hand checks the presence, 
absence, the polarity, the names, the colors, the polari -
ties, and the correct positioning of the components. On 
the other hand, it inspects the shape of the solder joints 
by their form detecting opens, shorts, cold solder joints 
and any type of defects related to wrong solder joints on 
reflow and wave applications. For this purpose, a part of 
the printed circuit board is illuminated according to the 
specifications of the software using RGB led, whereupon 
one or more cameras trigger and take images with color 
reflection. This creates one or more images from different 
angles, whose colors are later reconstructed using the 
Delvitech software. The frame grabbers synchronize the 
triggering of the cameras and the numerous light sources 
via a flash controller. After image acquisition, the images 
are corrected by the software in the course of image pre -
processing, for example their orientation. The AOI image processing system with the optical head is 
used in production plants. Due to the now given higher 
camera resolution, it achieves significantly better measu -
rement results at four times the speed and higher frame 
rate. This means that considerably more examinations of 
printed circuit boards can be carried out per minute – at 
the same cost of the overall system. The system now pro -
cesses images in just half a second, from acquisition and 
image pre-processing to merging and comparing the 
images, analyzing them and outputting the results. “The 
components can be flexibly exchanged and scaled 
regardless of the camera model and interface, and the 
system can be easily adapted to new customer require -
ments thanks to the accompanying applet,” states Gatti. 
In order to meet these requirements in the future, an 
extension of the system to 3D inspection with stereo 
vision is planned, which would further optimize the 
system.

Title:  Temperature State Feature – 
Removed on certain ace U and ace 
L cameras (part 3)  
Product Family:  ace U and  ace L  with certain sensors

Reason for Change  
The demand -supply -situation for semiconductor -related components has become 
increasingly tense  and it  is our utmost aim to provide our customers  with the most 
reliable and competitive lead times possible in this challenging environment .  
One component that faces a s hortage is a temperatu re sensor that is needed for the 
“Device Temperature  Feature ” and the “Temperature State Feature ”.  
Due to the shortage of the temperature sensor we will focus on delivering cameras 
and reduce the  feature scope . The “Device Temperature F eature ” won’t be of  use 
anymore and the “Temperature State Feature ” will be deactivated for the cameras 
listed below.   
We manage to stay within the UL certifications, but this means the cameras may only 
be operate d with a lens  or any other heat dissipating device . 
Once the demand -supply -situation  has relaxed, we plan to offer both feature s again. 
This will be published in another Product Change Notification.  
 
Affected cameras  (detailed list of models below):

Change Description  
 
The following Temperature R equirements  are specified in our Basler Product 
Documentation to operate the cameras listed below.  
Housing Temperature during operation  0-50 °C  
Housing Temperature according to UL  max. 70°C  
Ambient Temperature according to UL  max. 30°C  
UL test conditions : no lens attached to camera; no heat dissipation measures; 
ambient temperature kept at 30°C.  
 
The temperature limits will not change. However, to stay in accordance with UL  the 
test conditions were changed: cameras need to always be equipped with a lens . No 
camera exceeds the UL temperature limit of 70°C and all cameras will keep their UL 
certification.  
Please note that t o avoid burns or damaging the camera you must never use the 
camera without a lens  or alternative heat dissipation  to operate  the camera  
according to the specified maximum housing temperature of 50°C .  
 
 
The Device Temperature  camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the camera  (see Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below , the feature will still be accessible. However, 
because the se cameras will not be equipped with the temperature sensor, a  default  
value of 421°C  will be returned .

The Temperature State  camera feature indicates whether the camera's internal 
temperature is normal or too high.  In case of over temperature , the image acquisition 
is stopped and a  test image appears until the camera has cooled down again  (see 
Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below, the feature will be deactiva ted by removing the 
temperature thresholds. It will always return the parameter value “ok”.   
 
The over temperature threshold is for the following two purposes:  
1) Ensuring UL conformity of the camera .  
This requirement is still fulfilled as described  above.   
 
2) Preventing damage of the camera.   
At elevated temperatures, the camera may get damaged, the camera's lifetime is 
shortened, and image quality can degrade.  We therefore ask you to take special care 
to provide sufficient heat dissipation to maintain the temperat ure of the camera 
housing at 50 °C or less .  
 
If sufficient heat dissipation is provided in the application and cameras are operated 
according to the specified maximum housing temperature of 50°C , this product 
change does not have an impact on heat development within the camera.  
In case cameras in your application have switched to test images before (please see 
“Temperature State Feature” ), your application might exceed the specified operating 
temperature  and additional measures to provide sufficient heat dissipation might be 
needed. Please contact our Basle r Support team for assistance.  
If cameras in your  application haven’t switched  to test images before, the removed 
thresholds will have no  consequence.  
 
Please note that  you won’t be able to update future firmware versions on cameras that 
were produced  without the temperature sensor.

Reason for Change  
In order to serve  the high demand on our C23 5MP Premium Lens series we decided 
to accept slightly different mechanical parts on the outside of the lens. The 
appearance slightly differs, but this difference does not lead to any change in the 
usability or technical performance of the lens.  
Change Description  
 
The following picture shows the differences that can occur on this Lens s eries.  
Please be informed that both product designs can be delivered.  
 
 
- the silver ring is matt or shiny

flat or deep

Title: Simplified licensing model of 
VisualApplets  
Product Family: VisualApplets 
Release date:  November 1st, 2022  
Contact:     Basler Support  
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous     Firmware     PC Software 
 Product design   Process  
 
Reason for Change 
 
To enhance VisualApplets for Basler customers, the VisualApplets licensing model will 
be simplified starting with VisualApplets version 3.3.2.  
 
Change Description 
 
Starting from November 1st 2022, all licenses for previous VisualApplets extensions, 
e.g., VisualApplets 3 Expert License, VisualApplets 3 Debugging License, 
VisualApplets 3 Parameters Translation License, VA3 LIB JPEG Compression 
License, VA3 LIB Segment./Classification License, will be discontinued.  
Instead, these licenses will be automatically included into the VisualApplets IDE 
License. 
The same change also affects all corresponding VisualApplets test licenses, which will 
be included into the VisualApplets IDE (Eval.) License. 
The changes will be effective with VisualApplets version 3.3.2 and will apply to all 
upcoming VisualApplets versions.

Customers with a VisualApplets 3 IDE License valid for VisualApplets versions before 
3.3.2 have to purchase the new VisualApplets IDE License to benefit from the 
simplified licensing introduced with VisualApplets 3.3.2 and to be able to use 
upcoming VisualApplets versions, e.g., VisualApplets 4.x.

Title:  Device Temperature Feature – 
Removed on certain ace U and ace 
L cameras  
Product Family:  ace U and  ace L  with certain sensors  
Release date:  August 16, 2021 
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:

 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
The demand -supply -situation for semiconductor -related components has become 
increasingly tense  and it  is our utmost aim to provide our customers  with the most 
reliable and competitive lead times possible in this challenging environment .  
One component that faces a s hortage is a temperature sensor that is needed for the 
Device Temperature camera feature . This feature has never been officially supported 
and listed in our Basler Product Documentation for the cameras listed below. 
However, for the convenience of our customers it was available anyway.     
Due to the shortage of the temperature sensor we will focus on delivering cameras 
and go back to the officially stated feature scope . The Device Temperature camera 
feature won’t be of use  anymore for the cameras listed below.   
Once the demand -supply -situation has relaxed, we plan to offer the feature again. 
This will be published in another Product Change Notification.  
 
Affected cameras (detailed  list of models below):   
 ace L GigE  (IMX267, IMX304)  
 ace U USB (IMX226, IMX178)  
 ace U GigE (IMX226, IMX178)

Change Description  
 
The Device Temperature  camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the camera  (see Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below , the feature will still be accessible. However, 
because the se cameras will not be equipped with the temperature sensor, a  default  
value of 421°C  will be returned .   
 
The related  Temperature State  camera feature indicates whether the camera's 
internal temperature is normal or too high.  In case of over temperature , the image 
acquisition is stopped and a  test image appears until the camera has cooled down 
again.  
As stated in our Basler Product Documentation , the feature has never been supported 
by these cameras.  Nevertheless in pylon Viewer the feature has always shown the 
parameter value  “ok”, this will not change . 
   
This change does not have any impact on heat development within the cameras.

PCN Number :  02 2020  
Title:  Firmware  Update For ace 2 
Cameras  
Product Family:  ace 2  
Release date:  June  17, 2020 (PM)  
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
There are two main reasons for this new firmware release:  
1. We fixed a b ug in our ace 2 models which mainly limited the possible speed 
increase for our Compression Beyond feature on ace 2 GigE cameras.  
2. We added a new High Speed Burst Mode, allowing the user to trigger a 
predefined burst of images at the maximum sensor speed possible in our 
hardware.  
 
Change Description  
1. Fixed Bug  
The fixed behavior of our camera now allows the user to achieve a factor two increase 
in speed on ace 2 Pro GigE cameras by using the Compression Beyond feature. The 
accurate increase heavily depends on the working point of the camera (pixel form at, 
ROI, etc.).  
2. New High Speed Burst Mode  
Usually, the frame rate of the camera is not only limited by its sensor and internal 
buffer, but also by its ability to transfer data. This includes, e.g., the interface 
bandwidth or your network setup.  
The High Speed burst mode allows you to work around these data transfer limitations 
and acquire a burst of images as quickly as possible.  PRODUCT CHANGE NOTIFICATION

To achieve this, during a burst, acquiring images and filling the camera's internal 
buffer is highly prioritized over transmitt ing data. Usually, images will be transmitted 
only after all images of a burst have been acquired. This may introduce a delay after 
each burst, i.e., lower the burst rate.

documentation .

Change Description  
Sequencer  
The Sequencer  camera feature  allows you to define sets of parameter settings, called 
sequencer sets, and apply them to a sequence of image acquisitions.  
As the camera acquires images, it applies one sequencer set after the other. This 
enables you to quickly change camera parameters without compromising the 
maximum frame rate.  
For further information about  this feature  please take a look at our product 
documentation  or contact the Basler Support.  
 
Static Defect Pixel Correction  
The Defect Pixel Correction  camera feature  allows you to minimize the influence of 
sensitivity differences of individual pixels of the sensor.  
In acquired images, some pixels may appear significantly brighter or darker than the 
rest, even if uniform light is used. This problem is caused by differences in sensitivity 
of the individual pixels which in turn are due to production tolerances.  
The Static Defect Pixel Correction is based on files that are stored on the camera and 
contain a list of defect pixel coordinates.  
The following defect pixel correction files can be stored on the camera:  
• Factory file: Contains the coordinates of defect pixels that were detected during 
camera production. With this file, the camera corrects pixels that have a 
significantly  lower  intensity value than the neighboring pixels, including 
completely black pixels.  
• User fil e: Contains user -defined coordinates. You can upload this file to the 
camera. This allows you to define new defect pixels that might have occurred  
over time, regardless of whether these pixels are too dark or too bright.  
For further information about this  feature  please take a look at our product 
documentation  or contact the Basler Support.

CUSTOMER STORYMulti-talented: Basler boost with Customized 
Interface Card in a Line Scan Application
Customer
 MJV-Sähkö Oy and Lateral Engine Oy
 Location:  Lahti, Finland and Espoo, Finland
 Industry: Factory Automation
 Implementation: 2019-2020
Application
MJV-Sähkö Oy delivers machine vision systems with 
parameterization capability for the sorting of plywood 
sheets for the plywood industry. In their automation pro -
jects such as veneer grading it is important to work with 
efficient, up-to-date automation systems to achieve high 
productivity. The veneer grading process often uses line 
scan cameras that require a complex installation process. 
This is why MJV-Sähkö Oy was looking for a color area 
scan camera that not only fulfils the requirements for the 
inspection process of the veneer grading, but can also be 
installed easily.Solution and Benefits
In the veneer sheet grading application, the sheets (e.g. 
1800 mm wide) are imaged on a conveyor using high-
resolution line scan imaging. Software analyzes the 
sheets using modern deep-learning techniques and the 
results can be used by the manufacturing system for 
various purposes such as separating the sheets into diffe -
rent grades or splicing the material.
“There is nothing revolutionary in line scan applications 
but the novelty at the core of this Customer Story is how 
we communicated with Basler to implement a Basler area 
scan camera for the imaging”, states Jaakko Rantala from 
Lateral Engine Oy. The basic idea is to configure the 
camera and the interface card so that the camera uses an 
AOI of only a few lines at a very high frame rate (e.g. 4 
lines @ 2000 Hz, triggered by an encoder interface). The 
chunks of grouped lines are then efficiently stitched 
together on the interface card side before transferring 
the complete frames to the host software.
This was made possible by following:
 High-resolution CMOS sensor of the Basler boost 
camera
 High bandwidth achieved by the CoaXPress 2.0 
interface (Basler boost camera + Basler CXP-12 
interface card)
 Most importantly: the excellent collaboration with 
Basler in which the interface card was upgraded to 
support new features. The features consist of the line 
stitching and an encoder interface for camera 
triggering.

Title:  Temperature State Feature – 
Removed on certain ace U and ace 
L cameras  
Product Family:  ace U and  ace L  with certain sensors  
Release date:  August 23, 2021 
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
The demand -supply -situation for semiconductor -related components has become 
increasingly tense  and it  is our utmost aim to provide our customers  with the most 
reliable and competitive lead times possible in this challenging environment .  
One component that faces a s hortage is a temperature sensor that is needed for the 
“Device Temperature  Feature ” and the “Temperature State Feature ”.  
Due to the shortage of the temperature sensor we will focus on delivering cameras 
and reduce the  feature scope . The “Device Temperature F eature ” won’t be of use  
anymore and the “Temperature State Feature ” will be deactivated for the cameras 
listed below.   
Once the demand -supply -situation  has relaxed, we plan to offer both feature s again. 
This will be published in another Product Change Notification.  
 
Affected cameras  (detailed list of models below):  
 
 ace U GigE with IMX183, IMX265, Python  300, Python 500 and Python  1300 
Sensor   
 ace U USB with IMX273 mono, IMX265 mono, IMX264 m ono, IMX287 and 
Python  300 Sensor  
 
Depending on the  stock situation we might expand this measure to further cameras 
models soon.

We share this  initial version of the Product Change Notification by email once and 
publish updates  later on our Website. Therefore please closely monitor th is Product 
Change Notification on our Website . All recent updates are marked in red.  
 
Change Description  
 
The following Temperature R equirements  are specified in our Basler Product 
Documentation to operate the cameras listed below. These Requirements are still 
valid and will not change.  
Housing Temperature during operation  0-50 °C  
Housing Temperature according to UL 60950 -1 max. 70°C  
Ambient Temperature according to UL 60950 -1 max. 30°C  
UL 60950 -1 test conditions: no lens attached to camera; no heat dissipation 
measures; ambient temperature kept at 30°C.  
 
The Device Temperature  camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the camera  (see Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below , the feature will  still be accessible. However, 
because the se cameras will not be equipped with the temperature sensor, a  default  
value of 421°C  will be returned .   
 
The Temperature State  camera feature indicates whether the camera's internal 
temperature is normal or too high.  In case of over temperature , the image acquisition 
is stopped and a  test image appears until the camera has cooled down again  (see 
Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below, the feature will be deactivated by removing the 
temperature thresholds. It will always return the parameter value “ok”.

The over temperature threshold used to serve two purposes:  
1) Ensuring UL conformity of the camera .  
This requirement is still fulfilled. The threshold is only removed from models that do 
not exceed the maximum 70°C Housing Temperature according to UL 60950 -1.  
 
2) Preventing damage of the camera.   
At elevated temperatures, the camera may get damaged, the camera's lifetime is 
shortened, and image quality can degrade.  We therefore ask you to take special care 
to provide sufficient heat dissipation to maintain the temperat ure of the camera 
housing at 50 °C or less .  
 
If sufficient heat dissipation is provided in the application and cameras are operated 
according to the specified maximum housing temperature of 50°C , this product 
change does not have an impact on heat development within the camera.  
In case cameras in your application have switched to test images before (please see 
“Temperature State Feature” ), your application might exceed the specified operating 
temperature  and additional measures to provide sufficient heat dissipation might be 
needed. Please contact our Basle r Support team for assistance.  
If cameras in your  application haven’t switched  to test images before, the removed 
thresholds will have no  consequence.  
 
Please note that  you won’t be able to update future firmware versions on cameras that 
were produced  without the temperature sensor.

Title:  Change of packaging and MOQ for all 
dart models  
Product Family:  dart (all models)  
Release date:  January 15 , 2018  
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
Due to persistent  problems in logistics, inventory management and release 
management caused by single dart orders associated  with loans  and general design 
sample  as well as  custom dart prototype distribution all dart models (dar t USB, dart 
BCON for LVDS) are  now shipped  in single packaged units.  
 
Change Description  
To date , the dart USB as well as the dart BCON for LVDS camera modules have been  
shipped in package units of 5 cameras. Also, the minimum order  quantity for all dart 
models has been  5 pieces . Starting from January 15th 2018   this will change and all 
dart models (dart USB, dart BCON for LVDS) will be shipped to customers in single 
packaged units . In a ddition to that the MOQ is reduced to 1 piece for all models.  
The changeover to individual packaging has no effect on the current list prices of the 
dart family (dart USB, dart BCON for LVDS). Also, w ith changing the  minimum order 
quantity, all customers are no longer obliged to order a multiple of 5 dart cameras.

Title:  Vignetting Correction for several 
ace models  
Product Family: ace U and ace L 
Release date:  September 16, 2019  
Contact:     Basler Support  
Type of Change:

Reason for Change 
To provide our customers the best possible images, we always think of new features 
that help customers to improve their machines and a pplications. 
The most recent feature of this extension is Vignet ting Correction, which allows a 
correction of edge shadowing when the image circle is too small in relation to the 
sensor size.

Change Description 
Vignetting is a well-known phenomenon in image proc essing and describes the 
decrease in image brightness towards the edge. This  often results in this effect: 
           
Fig. 1 Left without Vignetting Correction Feature, R ight with Vignetting Correction Feature 
Our Vignetting Correction feature corrects this eff ect and at the same time there is no 
negative effect on the frame rate or image quality after a one-time calibration of the 
camera, since the correction values are stored in t he camera and automatically taken 
into account in the image output. 
Please note that you have to use pylon 5.2.0 or hig her to use the Vignetting Feature. 
Further details about the feature behavior and the usage can be found on: 
https://docs.baslerweb.com/#t=en%2Fvignetting_corre ction.htm

 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
We continuously optimize our products and processes. For this reason we decide d to 
optimize our Getting Started Guide.  The Getting Started Guide is a letter where we 
explain  how to get started with a camera . Until today it is  enclosed in every box within  
which  the camera is delivered.   
This change will lead to a better quality of information for our customers by using our 
online product documentation.  Furthermore, we avoid the usage of  unnecessary paper  
which is often discarded . This takes us one step closer to less paper consumption in 
terms of sustainability . 
Change Description  
 
The Getting Started Guide which is enclosed within the box  of each camera  will be 
exchanged by  an universal  product inlay card.

Change Description 
With revision 106202 – 17  the model acA1300-60gmNIR gets a new firmware vers ion.  
 
Reason for Change 
The firmware change was necessary to adapt the sens or behavior especially the 
saturation capacity due to production variation of the sensor manufacturer, but we 
make sure that it is within our camera test specifi cation.  
Due to production variation of the sensor manufactu rer – especially at the production 
of the silicon for sensors – it could came to minim al deviation of sensor behavior. This 
could appear at lower saturation capacity or bloomi ng effect at long exposure times 
and high gain on the other hand. 
Basler optimize this sensor behavior with the new f irmware to deliver the familiar 
quality at its best.

In particular, customers who use rolling shutter sensors and are already enthusiastic 
about the Basler SLP feature have asked for a longer pulse width of the SLP controlle r. 
Therefore, the Basler SLP Controller will now support a pulse width of 50µs up to 
100ms.  
We are very pleased that the new Basler SLP feature , which drives down the effort to 
integrate lightings in a vision system strongly , has been so well received from our 
customers.  
Further information about this feature can be found on:  
https://www.baslerweb.com/en/products/vision -components/basler -lighting/  
 
Change Description  
Basler SLP is an easy way to add lighting to a vision system.  
The Basler SLP camera feature enables the Basler SLP controller  to be used together 
with the all our popular ace U and ace L cameras . PRODUCT CHANGE NOTIFICATION

The feature enables the direct communication between the Basler SLP Controller and 
the camera, allowing the lighting to be easily operated in different modes such as 
continuous, strobe or overdrive.  
When using the Basler SLP Controller, the user can also b enefit from the compatibility 
with the Basler SLP feature and gain access to the simple lighting concept vi a a uniform 
software interface - Basler pylon Camera Software Suite . 
In addition users are given the freedom to choose from a variety of standard lig ht 
sources or use their own.  The solution is suitable for users with lighting experience who 
have applications with specific lighting requirements.  
Based on customer feedback, we have now extended the pulse width . Before this 
change a pulse width of  50µs up to 5 ms. Now each newly ordered Basler SLP Controller 
will support a pulse width of 50µs up to 100ms .  
We are happy that the Basler SLP Controller is now also the right choice for applications 
that require a longer pulse width.

acA640 -121gm  
Product Family:  ace U 
Release date:  29.04. 2019  
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
To provide our customers the best possible  replacement camera for the discontinued 
CCD sensor ICX618 , Basler  developed and just recently launched  the acA640 -121gm .  
In some cases users experience d long times for opening the camera. This long 
opening times are caused by the poor performance of olde r GenICam versions in 
caching the more complex GenICam XML Files in current cameras.  
In order to resolve that issue a more recent GenICam version or a new camera 
firmware is required.   
With this firmware release the acA640 -121gm comes along with two different XML 
Files in order to allow the best performance in both cases.  
 
Further information about  Baslers unique 1:1 replacement camera  acA640 -121 can be 
found on:

Change Description  
With this firmware release of FW1.1 -0 the acA640 -121gm comes along with two 
different XML Files.  
Due to the explained intended use as a replacement camera  for older camera models , 
the XML File for an improved behavior with older SDK/GenICam versions is set by 
default.  
If customers want to use the fully equipped feature set (e.g. including USEM, 
Sequencer, PGI, etc.) and are using a new SDK/GenICam version, it is possible to 
switch the XML file.

Reason for Change  
We optimized the mechanical design of the C23 5MP lens series to improve the 
adjustability and overall accuracy of the aperture. Due to this optimization the min F -
number  of the C23 5MP 16mm and 35mm lenses had to be changed.  
 
Change Description  
The minimum F-number ha d to be changed from f/1.8 to f/ 2.0. This was necessary 
due to overlapping tolerances. This should not be noticed in most applications and we 
don’t expect any impact on your system.  
Please note that the n aming has  change d too (see list below).

Title:  IR-Cut Filter  change  on  
dedicated  ace U cameras  
Product Family:  ace U

 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
Due to ong oing optimizations and process  improvements we changed the IR cut f ilter 
and der f ilter holder (also know n as “passepartout ”) for dedicated  ace U models.  
Change Description  
 
Effected models:  
- ace U with Python  300, Python  500 and Python1300 Sensors 
- ace U with IMX252 and IMX265 Sensors  
Please see detailed list with a ffected camera models below.  
The following pictures show a n IMX265 Sensor, where the difference is visible. The 
passepartout appears  a little bit smaller than the old one  and reduces diffused light. 
The specification  of the IR- Cut filter and their transmission did not change.

CUSTOMER STORYAlitheon Software and Basler ace Give Identity 
to Components Without the Use of Labels or 
Markings
Customer
 Alitheon, Inc. 
 Location: Bellevue, Washington, USA
 Industry: Factory Automation / Industrial Software
 Implementation: 2020
Application
Each year, global manufacturers and their suppliers 
deliver increasingly sophisticated products to their  
customers. Advanced vehicles, electronics, and other 
engineered goods now reach their markets through a 
precise physical and digital orchestration, with every 
component playing a role for quality and performance. 
Products such as, fasteners, circuit boards, castings, and 
even textiles must now be “smart” – uniquely identified 
and individually traceable. Yet these high-volume parts 
often resist identification, their design incompatible with 
barcode labels, etchings, or packaging. Alitheon was 
founded to solve this problem with a universal traceabi -
lity model, providing item-level certainty without altering 
product designs or manufacturing processes. With just a 
camera in the factory or in the field, Alitheon technology 
verifies the identity of virtually any object using software 
algorithms.
Through contactless machine vision, Alitheon software 
analyses the surface of every unique product or part, 
generating a digital code that differentiates it from even 
millions of seemingly identical objects. This FeaturePrint™ 
ID represents an authoritative, virtual serial number that 
can be stored, checked, and rechecked over an object’s 
entire useful life. In factory settings, FeaturePrint soft -
ware retrofits existing production lines through conti -
nuous-duty industrial cameras. With automated optics 
and sensors in place, even decades-old factory sites can 
easily receive an all-new digital control system to track 
goods. FeaturePrint endpoints can be attached to 
machine cells or operator stations, verifying the  
production flow, and generating data for the enterprise. 
Once a FeaturePrint ID is captured, it is available via cloud 
systems to allow goods to be verified anywhere – in 
plants, distribution channels, or with end users using a mobile app. In order to allow clear identification, Alitheon 
searched for a camera with the ability to capture even the 
smallest details and often during fast moving production 
lines.
Solution and Benefits 
Alitheon specifies Basler products through its Feature -
Print Automate and Feature Print Station components. 
Deployed within a machine retrofit chassis or a benchtop 
form factor, Basler ace L and Classic cameras generate 
images that keep up with production lines. In an automo -
tive setting, a powertrain part may transform through 
automated stages including raw stock, machining, heat 
treating, and grinding. In this case, a Basler camera ope -
rates at each of these four steps, triggering Alitheon’s 
FeaturePrint processing and ensuring continuous quality 
control. Or, in a contract electronics manufacturing 
scenario, a team of skilled operators may utilize multiple 
camera stations powered by Basler cameras and Alitheon 
technology to guide the correct assembly of circuit 
boards and modules. Later, in field service or aftermarket 
settings, the FeaturePrint ID originally generated onsite is 
available for product verification within a mobile app.

Title:  Device Temperature Feature 
available again  on ace U and 
ace L cameras  
Product Family:  ace U, ace L  
Release date:  February  22, 2022  
Update: J anuary  06, 2023 all changes

 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
 
Due to  the tense  demand -supply -situation we decided to remove  a temperature 
sensor which faced a shortage from our ace U and ace L cameras  in Q3/2021 . We 
focused on delivering cameras and reduced the feature scope.  
The Device Temperature Feature  was of no use and the Temperature State 
Feature  was deactivated.  
 
For further information please  see the published PCN’s from our website:   
Device Temperature Feature removed Part 1  
Device Temperature Feature removed Part 2  
Device Temperature Feature removed Part 3  
 
Now the temperature sensor is available again and we  change all cameras listed 
in the above mentioned PCNs back  to the original feature scope.

The Device Temperature camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the cameras (see Basler Product Documentation ). The feature will 
return a correct value agai n and no longer the default value of 421°C.  
 
The Temperature State  camera feature  (see Basler Product Documentation ) 
indicates whether the cameras internal temperature is normal or too high.  In case of 
over temperature, the image acquisition is stopped and a test image appears until the 
camera has cooled down again.  This feature will be activated again and work as 
before .   
Firmware updates are not possible for cameras which were  produced without 
temperature sensor. With this product change a firmware update to future firmware 
versions will be possible again.

Title:  Barcode Change on Product 
Packages  
Product Family:  Basler cameras   
Release date:  January  17th, 2023 
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
We as Basler see the traceability of our cameras as very important and equip our 
cameras  with a serial number on the camera itself and on the product outer package.  
The label on the camera outer  package lists the serial number in a barcode which is 
design ed and used especially for internal automated processes. Due to important 
internal system adaptions Basler needs to change the conte nt of the serial number 
barcode  shortly.  The following example shows a product package label with the 
affected barcode marke d red:  
  
We as Basler know about the importance of such an information and can imagine  that 
you as our customer process this information inside  your system as well.  Therefore, 
we would like to inform you herewith about this change and advise you to familiarize 
your scanning system with the new content . The change will take place s hort term 
beginning calendar week  3 in January 2023.

 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
The CoaXPress Premium Cables are subject of a mechanical design change. Reason 
are improvements of the longterm Basler supply chain from manufacturer to our 
customers with the focus on quality , stability and supply reliability . 
The compatibility of the cables with our CoaXPress cameras remain s the same.  
 
Change Description  
The main changes are:  
- the connector changes   
- the raw cable becomes thinner . Due to this, the minimum bending radius of the 
new cable design improves significantly.  
Currently, only the 3m and 5m version receive a design change. Longterm, also the 
10m Basler Premium CoaXPress Cable ( 2200000321 ) is expected to switch to  the 
new design. This will be published in a separate PCN.

Title:  New material codes for dart BCON for 
LVDS models / Development Kits  
Product Family:  dart BCON for LVDS, Development Kits

Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
 
Basler ’s embedded port folio exists  of camera modules and accompanying 
development kits. Up to  date the development kits have fallen under the product 
category  PowerPack s. In preparation for future portfolio extension s a new pr oduct 
category “Development Kits ” has now been created . As a consequence, the product 
type of the current development kits has changed accordingly.  
The dart BCON for LVDS is Basler’s first camera module with a low -level embedded 
interfac e. BCON is Basler’s proprietary interface technology for embedded systems. In 
preparation for future portfolio extensions based on BCON technology the material 
codes for all dart BCON for LVDS models have changed.  
 
Change Description  
 
In Basler’s material  codes the second last letter describes which interface the camera 
or camera module provides.   
Example:  daA1280 -54bm  
For all dart BCON for LVDS models this letter has now changed from b (BCON)  to l 
(LVDS).   
Example:  daA1280 -54lm  
Please find below a list of all dart BCON for LVDS models with new material codes.

Reason for Change  
 
Due to the ongoing component crisis, our supplier ADLINK has adapted the electrical 
design of the PCIe -GIE74.  
The standard functions of the interface card remain unchanged.  
If the ADLINK SDK is used for special functions, a new validation is recommended.  
Change Description  
 
The new design has replaced different power components, a micro controller and the 
PCIe switch. For normal use cases without using the ADLINK SDK for POE controlling 
the new version can be used.

Change Description 
In the design of the camera’s coreboard some improv ements were made. One change 
is implementing a new voltage regulation by changin g the input voltage and 
implementing a switch. Furthermore the layout was o ptimized. 
 
Reason for Change 
The change was originally made to reduce the power consumption of new high 
resolution and high speed camera models as for exam ple the acA2500-60um/uc.  
As these models and following camera models are sti ll under development, the mass 
production of these models will already start with the new coreboard.

CUSTOMER STORYAOI System with Frame Grabbers and FPGA 
Applet from Silicon Software 
Delvitech from Switzerland offers automatic optical inspection (AOI) to prevent process errors, increase the yield 
and reduce the costs in the manufacturing of assembled printed circuit boards (PCB). The core element of these 
systems is an optical head consisting of five cameras and various side-mounted illuminations. The company recently 
developed a new head upgrade for its AOI systems installed in the market, with more powerful cameras and frame 
grabbers – and is now benefiting of important sales, offering solutions significantly better with higher speed, 
improved detectability and greater flexibility. 
Delvitech needed new cameras for the optical head, as 
the existing ones lagged behind the desired high image 
quality. The cameras had to achieve a higher resolution, 
have suitable interfaces to the new frame grabbers and 
acquire at least 30 frames per second. For the scalability 
of the system, the interchangeability of cameras and 
frame grabbers was an important requirement, indepen -
dent of the camera interface and without changing the 
image processing software developed in-house. 
In the optical head there are a camera at the top and four 
cameras at the side together with 24 xenon light sources, 
4 RGB leds and a special sensor. A monochrome CMOS 
area scan camera 25 Mpixel with CoaXPress interface 
was selected for the upper camera instead of the pre -
vious 4 MP resolution camera. Four monochrome Camera 
Link Basler ace CMOS with 4 MP resolution and 180 
frames per second are now used for the side cameras 
replacing the previous analog ones. The upper camera 
has a larger sensor so that fine features can be better 
resolved or the same level of performance can be main -
tained at a higher throughput. Due to the also larger 
sensors of the side cameras, discrepancies in the resolu -
tion between all cameras are reduced. The selected 
cameras are dimensioned to run below their potential 
performance and therefore allow the performance of the 
system to be enhanced at a later stage. Scalability and Great Flexibility 
The disadvantage of the frame grabbers used so far was 
that they were only suitable for special cameras and were 
incompatible with the new high performance cameras 
selected, the intended light sources and the self-deve -
loped software based on algorithms with artificial intelli -
gence. Therefore Delvitech chose two different program -
mable frame grabbers from Silicon Software, both com -
patible with diverse cameras and lighting as well as the 
software. The upper camera, four side cameras and the 
lighting are synchronized by the microEnable 5 VCX-QP 
CoaXPress frame grabber, while the up to four side 
cameras are triggered by two Camera Link frame grab -
bers microEnable 5 VCL. With the system upgrade, Del -
vitech also switched to the very powerful 64bit D.ONE 
Core. 
The system was designed for scalability with the use of 
one standard camera up to five high-end cameras in the 
highest expansion stage, which the frame grabbers 
support. In order to connect them to the software, the 
project partners jointly developed image acquisition 
functions as a hardware applet using the FPGA develop -
ment environment VisualApplets from Silicon Software 
with the advantage that the frame grabbers, already 
during the image transfer, always generate the same 
output format. This means that the software can be easily 
further used when changing cameras, frame grabbers or 
the camera interface. The applet was designed as a data 
flow model and synthesized as FPGA code for the runtime 
environment on the frame grabber. The overall imple -
mentation of hardware, software and applet was com -
pleted within a few days. “We owe the short development 
time to Silicon Software‘s extraordinary consulting com -
petence and operational readiness. On the basis of only 
two coaching sessions the design-in could be completed 
entirely,” explains Roberto Gatti, VP Sales and Marketing 
of Delvitech.

High-Quality Software Included 
When inspecting assembled printed circuit boards, the 
AOI system on the one hand checks the presence, 
absence, the polarity, the names, the colors, the polari -
ties, and the correct positioning of the components. On 
the other hand, it inspects the shape of the solder joints 
by their form detecting opens, shorts, cold solder joints 
and any type of defects related to wrong solder joints on 
reflow and wave applications. For this purpose, a part of 
the printed circuit board is illuminated according to the 
specifications of the software using RGB led, whereupon 
one or more cameras trigger and take images with color 
reflection. This creates one or more images from different 
angles, whose colors are later reconstructed using the 
Delvitech software. The frame grabbers synchronize the 
triggering of the cameras and the numerous light sources 
via a flash controller. After image acquisition, the images 
are corrected by the software in the course of image pre -
processing, for example their orientation. The AOI image processing system with the optical head is 
used in production plants. Due to the now given higher 
camera resolution, it achieves significantly better measu -
rement results at four times the speed and higher frame 
rate. This means that considerably more examinations of 
printed circuit boards can be carried out per minute – at 
the same cost of the overall system. The system now pro -
cesses images in just half a second, from acquisition and 
image pre-processing to merging and comparing the 
images, analyzing them and outputting the results. “The 
components can be flexibly exchanged and scaled 
regardless of the camera model and interface, and the 
system can be easily adapted to new customer require -
ments thanks to the accompanying applet,” states Gatti. 
In order to meet these requirements in the future, an 
extension of the system to 3D inspection with stereo 
vision is planned, which would further optimize the 
system.

Title:  Temperature State Feature – 
Removed on certain ace U and ace 
L cameras (part 3)  
Product Family:  ace U and  ace L  with certain sensors  
Release date:  September  06, 2021 
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
The demand -supply -situation for semiconductor -related components has become 
increasingly tense  and it  is our utmost aim to provide our customers  with the most 
reliable and competitive lead times possible in this challenging environment .  
One component that faces a s hortage is a temperatu re sensor that is needed for the 
“Device Temperature  Feature ” and the “Temperature State Feature ”.  
Due to the shortage of the temperature sensor we will focus on delivering cameras 
and reduce the  feature scope . The “Device Temperature F eature ” won’t be of  use 
anymore and the “Temperature State Feature ” will be deactivated for the cameras 
listed below.   
We manage to stay within the UL certifications, but this means the cameras may only 
be operate d with a lens  or any other heat dissipating device . 
Once the demand -supply -situation  has relaxed, we plan to offer both feature s again. 
This will be published in another Product Change Notification.  
 
Affected cameras  (detailed list of models below):  
ace U GigE with the following sensors: Python 2000, Python 5000, IMX174, IMX249, 
IMX273, IMX287, IMX264, ICX618 Replacement  
 
ace U and ace L USB with the following sensors: Python 500, Python 1300, Python 
2000, Python 5000, IMX174, IMX249, IMX250, IMX252, IMX183, IMX304, IMX253,

Change Description  
 
The following Temperature R equirements  are specified in our Basler Product 
Documentation to operate the cameras listed below.  
Housing Temperature during operation  0-50 °C  
Housing Temperature according to UL  max. 70°C  
Ambient Temperature according to UL  max. 30°C  
UL test conditions : no lens attached to camera; no heat dissipation measures; 
ambient temperature kept at 30°C.  
 
The temperature limits will not change. However, to stay in accordance with UL  the 
test conditions were changed: cameras need to always be equipped with a lens . No 
camera exceeds the UL temperature limit of 70°C and all cameras will keep their UL 
certification.  
Please note that t o avoid burns or damaging the camera you must never use the 
camera without a lens  or alternative heat dissipation  to operate  the camera  
according to the specified maximum housing temperature of 50°C .  
 
 
The Device Temperature  camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the camera  (see Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below , the feature will still be accessible. However, 
because the se cameras will not be equipped with the temperature sensor, a  default  
value of 421°C  will be returned .

The Temperature State  camera feature indicates whether the camera's internal 
temperature is normal or too high.  In case of over temperature , the image acquisition 
is stopped and a  test image appears until the camera has cooled down again  (see 
Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below, the feature will be deactiva ted by removing the 
temperature thresholds. It will always return the parameter value “ok”.   
 
The over temperature threshold is for the following two purposes:  
1) Ensuring UL conformity of the camera .  
This requirement is still fulfilled as described  above.   
 
2) Preventing damage of the camera.   
At elevated temperatures, the camera may get damaged, the camera's lifetime is 
shortened, and image quality can degrade.  We therefore ask you to take special care 
to provide sufficient heat dissipation to maintain the temperat ure of the camera 
housing at 50 °C or less .  
 
If sufficient heat dissipation is provided in the application and cameras are operated 
according to the specified maximum housing temperature of 50°C , this product 
change does not have an impact on heat development within the camera.  
In case cameras in your application have switched to test images before (please see 
“Temperature State Feature” ), your application might exceed the specified operating 
temperature  and additional measures to provide sufficient heat dissipation might be 
needed. Please contact our Basle r Support team for assistance.  
If cameras in your  application haven’t switched  to test images before, the removed 
thresholds will have no  consequence.  
 
Please note that  you won’t be able to update future firmware versions on cameras that 
were produced  without the temperature sensor.

usability or technical performance of the lens.  
Change Description  
 
The following picture shows the differences that can occur on this Lens s eries.  
Please be informed that both product designs can be delivered.

Title: Simplified licensing model of 
VisualApplets  
Product Family: VisualApplets 
Release date:  November 1st, 2022  
Contact:     Basler Support  
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous     Firmware     PC Software 
 Product design   Process  
 
Reason for Change 
 
To enhance VisualApplets for Basler customers, the VisualApplets licensing model will 
be simplified starting with VisualApplets version 3.3.2.  
 
Change Description 
 
Starting from November 1st 2022, all licenses for previous VisualApplets extensions, 
e.g., VisualApplets 3 Expert License, VisualApplets 3 Debugging License, 
VisualApplets 3 Parameters Translation License, VA3 LIB JPEG Compression 
License, VA3 LIB Segment./Classification License, will be discontinued.  
Instead, these licenses will be automatically included into the VisualApplets IDE 
License. 
The same change also affects all corresponding VisualApplets test licenses, which will 
be included into the VisualApplets IDE (Eval.) License. 
The changes will be effective with VisualApplets version 3.3.2 and will apply to all 
upcoming VisualApplets versions.

Customers with a VisualApplets 3 IDE License valid for VisualApplets versions before 
3.3.2 have to purchase the new VisualApplets IDE License to benefit from the 
simplified licensing introduced with VisualApplets 3.3.2 and to be able to use 
upcoming VisualApplets versions, e.g., VisualApplets 4.x.

Title:  Device Temperature Feature – 
Removed on certain ace U and ace 
L cameras  
Product Family:  ace U and  ace L  with certain sensors  
Release date:  August 16, 2021 
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
The demand -supply -situation for semiconductor -related components has become 
increasingly tense  and it  is our utmost aim to provide our customers  with the most 
reliable and competitive lead times possible in this challenging environment .  
One component that faces a s hortage is a temperature sensor that is needed for the 
Device Temperature camera feature . This feature has never been officially supported 
and listed in our Basler Product Documentation for the cameras listed below. 
However, for the convenience of our customers it was available anyway.     
Due to the shortage of the temperature sensor we will focus on delivering cameras 
and go back to the officially stated feature scope . The Device Temperature camera 
feature won’t be of use  anymore for the cameras listed below.   
Once the demand -supply -situation has relaxed, we plan to offer the feature again. 
This will be published in another Product Change Notification.  
 
Affected cameras (detailed  list of models below):   
 ace L GigE  (IMX267, IMX304)  
 ace U USB (IMX226, IMX178)  
 ace U GigE (IMX226, IMX178)

Change Description  
 
The Device Temperature  camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the camera  (see Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below , the feature will still be accessible. However, 
because the se cameras will not be equipped with the temperature sensor, a  default  
value of 421°C  will be returned .   
 
The related  Temperature State  camera feature indicates whether the camera's 
internal temperature is normal or too high.  In case of over temperature , the image 
acquisition is stopped and a  test image appears until the camera has cooled down 
again.  
As stated in our Basler Product Documentation , the feature has never been supported 
by these cameras.  Nevertheless in pylon Viewer the feature has always shown the 
parameter value  “ok”, this will not change . 
   
This change does not have any impact on heat development within the cameras.

Title:  Firmware  Update For ace 2 
Cameras  
Product Family:  ace 2  
Release date:  June  17, 2020 (PM)  
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
There are two main reasons for this new firmware release:  
1. We fixed a b ug in our ace 2 models which mainly limited the possible speed 
increase for our Compression Beyond feature on ace 2 GigE cameras.  
2. We added a new High Speed Burst Mode, allowing the user to trigger a 
predefined burst of images at the maximum sensor speed possible in our 
hardware.  
 
Change Description  
1. Fixed Bug  
The fixed behavior of our camera now allows the user to achieve a factor two increase 
in speed on ace 2 Pro GigE cameras by using the Compression Beyond feature. The 
accurate increase heavily depends on the working point of the camera (pixel form at, 
ROI, etc.).  
2. New High Speed Burst Mode  
Usually, the frame rate of the camera is not only limited by its sensor and internal 
buffer, but also by its ability to transfer data. This includes, e.g., the interface 
bandwidth or your network setup.  
The High Speed burst mode allows you to work around these data transfer limitations 
and acquire a burst of images as quickly as possible.  PRODUCT CHANGE NOTIFICATION

To achieve this, during a burst, acquiring images and filling the camera's internal 
buffer is highly prioritized over transmitt ing data. Usually, images will be transmitted 
only after all images of a burst have been acquired. This may introduce a delay after 
each burst, i.e., lower the burst rate.

documentation .

Change Description  
Sequencer  
The Sequencer  camera feature  allows you to define sets of parameter settings, called 
sequencer sets, and apply them to a sequence of image acquisitions.  
As the camera acquires images, it applies one sequencer set after the other. This 
enables you to quickly change camera parameters without compromising the 
maximum frame rate.  
For further information about  this feature  please take a look at our product 
documentation  or contact the Basler Support.  
 
Static Defect Pixel Correction  
The Defect Pixel Correction  camera feature  allows you to minimize the influence of 
sensitivity differences of individual pixels of the sensor.  
In acquired images, some pixels may appear significantly brighter or darker than the 
rest, even if uniform light is used. This problem is caused by differences in sensitivity 
of the individual pixels which in turn are due to production tolerances.  
The Static Defect Pixel Correction is based on files that are stored on the camera and 
contain a list of defect pixel coordinates.  
The following defect pixel correction files can be stored on the camera:  
• Factory file: Contains the coordinates of defect pixels that were detected during 
camera production. With this file, the camera corrects pixels that have a 
significantly  lower  intensity value than the neighboring pixels, including 
completely black pixels.  
• User fil e: Contains user -defined coordinates. You can upload this file to the 
camera. This allows you to define new defect pixels that might have occurred  
over time, regardless of whether these pixels are too dark or too bright.  
For further information about this  feature  please take a look at our product 
documentation  or contact the Basler Support.

CUSTOMER STORYMulti-talented: Basler boost with Customized 
Interface Card in a Line Scan Application
Customer
 MJV-Sähkö Oy and Lateral Engine Oy
 Location:  Lahti, Finland and Espoo, Finland
 Industry: Factory Automation
 Implementation: 2019-2020
Application
MJV-Sähkö Oy delivers machine vision systems with 
parameterization capability for the sorting of plywood 
sheets for the plywood industry. In their automation pro -
jects such as veneer grading it is important to work with 
efficient, up-to-date automation systems to achieve high 
productivity. The veneer grading process often uses line 
scan cameras that require a complex installation process. 
This is why MJV-Sähkö Oy was looking for a color area 
scan camera that not only fulfils the requirements for the 
inspection process of the veneer grading, but can also be 
installed easily.Solution and Benefits
In the veneer sheet grading application, the sheets (e.g. 
1800 mm wide) are imaged on a conveyor using high-
resolution line scan imaging. Software analyzes the 
sheets using modern deep-learning techniques and the 
results can be used by the manufacturing system for 
various purposes such as separating the sheets into diffe -
rent grades or splicing the material.
“There is nothing revolutionary in line scan applications 
but the novelty at the core of this Customer Story is how 
we communicated with Basler to implement a Basler area 
scan camera for the imaging”, states Jaakko Rantala from 
Lateral Engine Oy. The basic idea is to configure the 
camera and the interface card so that the camera uses an 
AOI of only a few lines at a very high frame rate (e.g. 4 
lines @ 2000 Hz, triggered by an encoder interface). The 
chunks of grouped lines are then efficiently stitched 
together on the interface card side before transferring 
the complete frames to the host software.
This was made possible by following:
 High-resolution CMOS sensor of the Basler boost 
camera
 High bandwidth achieved by the CoaXPress 2.0 
interface (Basler boost camera + Basler CXP-12 
interface card)
 Most importantly: the excellent collaboration with 
Basler in which the interface card was upgraded to 
support new features. The features consist of the line 
stitching and an encoder interface for camera 
triggering.

Due to the shortage of the temperature sensor we will focus on delivering cameras 
and reduce the  feature scope . The “Device Temperature F eature ” won’t be of use  
anymore and the “Temperature State Feature ” will be deactivated for the cameras 
listed below.   
Once the demand -supply -situation  has relaxed, we plan to offer both feature s again. 
This will be published in another Product Change Notification.  
 
Affected cameras  (detailed list of models below):  
 
 ace U GigE with IMX183, IMX265, Python  300, Python 500 and Python  1300 
Sensor   
 ace U USB with IMX273 mono, IMX265 mono, IMX264 m ono, IMX287 and 
Python  300 Sensor  
 
Depending on the  stock situation we might expand this measure to further cameras 
models soon.

Change Description  
 
The following Temperature R equirements  are specified in our Basler Product 
Documentation to operate the cameras listed below. These Requirements are still 
valid and will not change.  
Housing Temperature during operation  0-50 °C  
Housing Temperature according to UL 60950 -1 max. 70°C  
Ambient Temperature according to UL 60950 -1 max. 30°C  
UL 60950 -1 test conditions: no lens attached to camera; no heat dissipation 
measures; ambient temperature kept at 30°C.  
 
The Device Temperature  camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the camera  (see Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below , the feature will  still be accessible. However, 
because the se cameras will not be equipped with the temperature sensor, a  default  
value of 421°C  will be returned .   
 
The Temperature State  camera feature indicates whether the camera's internal 
temperature is normal or too high.  In case of over temperature , the image acquisition 
is stopped and a  test image appears until the camera has cooled down again  (see 
Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below, the feature will be deactivated by removing the 
temperature thresholds. It will always return the parameter value “ok”.

The over temperature threshold used to serve two purposes:  
1) Ensuring UL conformity of the camera .  
This requirement is still fulfilled. The threshold is only removed from models that do 
not exceed the maximum 70°C Housing Temperature according to UL 60950 -1.  
 
2) Preventing damage of the camera.   
At elevated temperatures, the camera may get damaged, the camera's lifetime is 
shortened, and image quality can degrade.  We therefore ask you to take special care 
to provide sufficient heat dissipation to maintain the temperat ure of the camera 
housing at 50 °C or less .  
 
If sufficient heat dissipation is provided in the application and cameras are operated 
according to the specified maximum housing temperature of 50°C , this product 
change does not have an impact on heat development within the camera.  
In case cameras in your application have switched to test images before (please see 
“Temperature State Feature” ), your application might exceed the specified operating 
temperature  and additional measures to provide sufficient heat dissipation might be 
needed. Please contact our Basle r Support team for assistance.  
If cameras in your  application haven’t switched  to test images before, the removed 
thresholds will have no  consequence.  
 
Please note that  you won’t be able to update future firmware versions on cameras that 
were produced  without the temperature sensor.

Title:  Change of packaging and MOQ for all 
dart models  
Product Family:  dart (all models)  
Release date:  January 15 , 2018  
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
Due to persistent  problems in logistics, inventory management and release 
management caused by single dart orders associated  with loans  and general design 
sample  as well as  custom dart prototype distribution all dart models (dar t USB, dart 
BCON for LVDS) are  now shipped  in single packaged units.  
 
Change Description  
To date , the dart USB as well as the dart BCON for LVDS camera modules have been  
shipped in package units of 5 cameras. Also, the minimum order  quantity for all dart 
models has been  5 pieces . Starting from January 15th 2018   this will change and all 
dart models (dart USB, dart BCON for LVDS) will be shipped to customers in single 
packaged units . In a ddition to that the MOQ is reduced to 1 piece for all models.  
The changeover to individual packaging has no effect on the current list prices of the 
dart family (dart USB, dart BCON for LVDS). Also, w ith changing the  minimum order 
quantity, all customers are no longer obliged to order a multiple of 5 dart cameras.

Title:  Vignetting Correction for several 
ace models  
Product Family: ace U and ace L 
Release date:  September 16, 2019  
Contact:     Basler Support  
Type of Change:

Reason for Change 
To provide our customers the best possible images, we always think of new features 
that help customers to improve their machines and a pplications.

Change Description 
Vignetting is a well-known phenomenon in image proc essing and describes the 
decrease in image brightness towards the edge. This  often results in this effect: 
           
Fig. 1 Left without Vignetting Correction Feature, R ight with Vignetting Correction Feature 
Our Vignetting Correction feature corrects this eff ect and at the same time there is no 
negative effect on the frame rate or image quality after a one-time calibration of the 
camera, since the correction values are stored in t he camera and automatically taken 
into account in the image output. 
Please note that you have to use pylon 5.2.0 or hig her to use the Vignetting Feature. 
Further details about the feature behavior and the usage can be found on:

Product Family:  Ace 2

Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
We continuously optimize our products and processes. For this reason we decide d to 
optimize our Getting Started Guide.  The Getting Started Guide is a letter where we 
explain  how to get started with a camera . Until today it is  enclosed in every box within  
which  the camera is delivered.   
This change will lead to a better quality of information for our customers by using our 
online product documentation.  Furthermore, we avoid the usage of  unnecessary paper  
which is often discarded . This takes us one step closer to less paper consumption in 
terms of sustainability . 
Change Description  
 
The Getting Started Guide which is enclosed within the box  of each camera  will be 
exchanged by  an universal  product inlay card.

Change Description 
With revision 106202 – 17  the model acA1300-60gmNIR gets a new firmware vers ion.  
 
Reason for Change 
The firmware change was necessary to adapt the sens or behavior especially the 
saturation capacity due to production variation of the sensor manufacturer, but we 
make sure that it is within our camera test specifi cation.  
Due to production variation of the sensor manufactu rer – especially at the production 
of the silicon for sensors – it could came to minim al deviation of sensor behavior. This 
could appear at lower saturation capacity or bloomi ng effect at long exposure times 
and high gain on the other hand. 
Basler optimize this sensor behavior with the new f irmware to deliver the familiar 
quality at its best.

Title:  Basler SLP Controller now up to  
100ms pulse width  
Product Family:  Basler Lighting

Type of Change:

 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
To provide our customers the best poss ible images, we continuously listen to the 
feedback of our customers  to improve their machines and applications.  
In particular, customers who use rolling shutter sensors and are already enthusiastic 
about the Basler SLP feature have asked for a longer pulse width of the SLP controlle r. 
Therefore, the Basler SLP Controller will now support a pulse width of 50µs up to 
100ms.  
We are very pleased that the new Basler SLP feature , which drives down the effort to 
integrate lightings in a vision system strongly , has been so well received from our 
customers.  
Further information about this feature can be found on:  
https://www.baslerweb.com/en/products/vision -components/basler -lighting/  
 
Change Description  
Basler SLP is an easy way to add lighting to a vision system.  
The Basler SLP camera feature enables the Basler SLP controller  to be used together 
with the all our popular ace U and ace L cameras . PRODUCT CHANGE NOTIFICATION

The feature enables the direct communication between the Basler SLP Controller and 
the camera, allowing the lighting to be easily operated in different modes such as 
continuous, strobe or overdrive.  
When using the Basler SLP Controller, the user can also b enefit from the compatibility 
with the Basler SLP feature and gain access to the simple lighting concept vi a a uniform 
software interface - Basler pylon Camera Software Suite . 
In addition users are given the freedom to choose from a variety of standard lig ht 
sources or use their own.  The solution is suitable for users with lighting experience who 
have applications with specific lighting requirements.  
Based on customer feedback, we have now extended the pulse width . Before this 
change a pulse width of  50µs up to 5 ms. Now each newly ordered Basler SLP Controller 
will support a pulse width of 50µs up to 100ms .  
We are happy that the Basler SLP Controller is now also the right choice for applications 
that require a longer pulse width.

Title:  Firmware Update on         
acA640 -121gm  
Product Family:  ace U 
Release date:  29.04. 2019  
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
To provide our customers the best possible  replacement camera for the discontinued 
CCD sensor ICX618 , Basler  developed and just recently launched  the acA640 -121gm .  
In some cases users experience d long times for opening the camera. This long 
opening times are caused by the poor performance of olde r GenICam versions in 
caching the more complex GenICam XML Files in current cameras.  
In order to resolve that issue a more recent GenICam version or a new camera 
firmware is required.   
With this firmware release the acA640 -121gm comes along with two different XML 
Files in order to allow the best performance in both cases.  
 
Further information about  Baslers unique 1:1 replacement camera  acA640 -121 can be 
found on:

Change Description  
With this firmware release of FW1.1 -0 the acA640 -121gm comes along with two 
different XML Files.  
Due to the explained intended use as a replacement camera  for older camera models , 
the XML File for an improved behavior with older SDK/GenICam versions is set by 
default.  
If customers want to use the fully equipped feature set (e.g. including USEM, 
Sequencer, PGI, etc.) and are using a new SDK/GenICam version, it is possible to 
switch the XML file.

CUSTOMER STORYAlitheon Software and Basler ace Give Identity 
to Components Without the Use of Labels or 
Markings
Customer
 Alitheon, Inc. 
 Location: Bellevue, Washington, USA
 Industry: Factory Automation / Industrial Software
 Implementation: 2020
Application
Each year, global manufacturers and their suppliers 
deliver increasingly sophisticated products to their  
customers. Advanced vehicles, electronics, and other 
engineered goods now reach their markets through a 
precise physical and digital orchestration, with every 
component playing a role for quality and performance. 
Products such as, fasteners, circuit boards, castings, and 
even textiles must now be “smart” – uniquely identified 
and individually traceable. Yet these high-volume parts 
often resist identification, their design incompatible with 
barcode labels, etchings, or packaging. Alitheon was 
founded to solve this problem with a universal traceabi -
lity model, providing item-level certainty without altering 
product designs or manufacturing processes. With just a 
camera in the factory or in the field, Alitheon technology 
verifies the identity of virtually any object using software 
algorithms.
Through contactless machine vision, Alitheon software 
analyses the surface of every unique product or part, 
generating a digital code that differentiates it from even 
millions of seemingly identical objects. This FeaturePrint™ 
ID represents an authoritative, virtual serial number that 
can be stored, checked, and rechecked over an object’s 
entire useful life. In factory settings, FeaturePrint soft -
ware retrofits existing production lines through conti -
nuous-duty industrial cameras. With automated optics 
and sensors in place, even decades-old factory sites can 
easily receive an all-new digital control system to track 
goods. FeaturePrint endpoints can be attached to 
machine cells or operator stations, verifying the  
production flow, and generating data for the enterprise. 
Once a FeaturePrint ID is captured, it is available via cloud 
systems to allow goods to be verified anywhere – in 
plants, distribution channels, or with end users using a mobile app. In order to allow clear identification, Alitheon 
searched for a camera with the ability to capture even the 
smallest details and often during fast moving production 
lines.
Solution and Benefits 
Alitheon specifies Basler products through its Feature -
Print Automate and Feature Print Station components. 
Deployed within a machine retrofit chassis or a benchtop 
form factor, Basler ace L and Classic cameras generate 
images that keep up with production lines. In an automo -
tive setting, a powertrain part may transform through 
automated stages including raw stock, machining, heat 
treating, and grinding. In this case, a Basler camera ope -
rates at each of these four steps, triggering Alitheon’s 
FeaturePrint processing and ensuring continuous quality 
control. Or, in a contract electronics manufacturing 
scenario, a team of skilled operators may utilize multiple 
camera stations powered by Basler cameras and Alitheon 
technology to guide the correct assembly of circuit 
boards and modules. Later, in field service or aftermarket 
settings, the FeaturePrint ID originally generated onsite is 
available for product verification within a mobile app.

 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
We continuously optimize our products and processes. For this reason we decide d to 
optimize our Getting Started Guide.  The Getting Started Guide is a letter where we 
explain  how to get started with a camera . Until today it is  enclosed in every box within  
which the camera is delivered.   
This change will lead to a better quality of information for our customers by using our 
online product documentation.  Furthermore, we avoid the usage of  unnecessary paper  
which is often discarded . This takes us one step closer to less paper consumption in 
terms of sustainability . 
Change Description  
 
The Getting Started Guide which is enclosed within the box  of each camera  will be 
exchanged by  an universal  product inlay card.

Title:  Device Temperature Feature 
available again  on ace U and

Reason for Change  
 
Due to  the tense  demand -supply -situation we decided to remove  a temperature 
sensor which faced a shortage from our ace U and ace L cameras  in Q3/2021 . We 
focused on delivering cameras and reduced the feature scope.  
The Device Temperature Feature  was of no use and the Temperature State 
Feature  was deactivated.  
 
For further information please  see the published PCN’s from our website:   
Device Temperature Feature removed Part 1  
Device Temperature Feature removed Part 2  
Device Temperature Feature removed Part 3  
 
Now the temperature sensor is available again and we  change all cameras listed 
in the above mentioned PCNs back  to the original feature scope.

The Device Temperature camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the cameras (see Basler Product Documentation ). The feature will 
return a correct value agai n and no longer the default value of 421°C.  
 
The Temperature State  camera feature  (see Basler Product Documentation ) 
indicates whether the cameras internal temperature is normal or too high.  In case of 
over temperature, the image acquisition is stopped and a test image appears until the 
camera has cooled down again.  This feature will be activated again and work as 
before .   
Firmware updates are not possible for cameras which were  produced without 
temperature sensor. With this product change a firmware update to future firmware 
versions will be possible again.

Title:  Barcode Change on Product 
Packages  
Product Family:  Basler cameras

Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
We as Basler see the traceability of our cameras as very important and equip our 
cameras  with a serial number on the camera itself and on the product outer package.  
The label on the camera outer  package lists the serial number in a barcode which is 
design ed and used especially for internal automated processes. Due to important 
internal system adaptions Basler needs to change the conte nt of the serial number 
barcode  shortly.  The following example shows a product package label with the 
affected barcode marke d red:  
  
We as Basler know about the importance of such an information and can imagine  that 
you as our customer process this information inside  your system as well.  Therefore, 
we would like to inform you herewith about this change and advise you to familiarize 
your scanning system with the new content . The change will take place s hort term 
beginning calendar week  3 in January 2023.

Title: New Firmware Features on ace 2  
Product Family: ace 2 
Release date:  February 2022  
Contact:     Basler Support 
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous     Firmware     PC Software 
 Product design   Process  
 
Reason for Change 
To offer an even higher value to our customers, new features were added to the ace 2 
firmware and power consumption has been reduced. Furthermore, the new firmware 
delivers maintenance work and corrects deviating camera behaviors. 
 
Change Description 
 
Basler has added valuable features to the ace 2 family which are available on all 
interfaces. 
For your convenience, the Device Link Speed  as well as the Effective Exposure 
Time might now be read out. Additionally, the Sensor State  of the camera can be 
configurated by choosing the values On, Off or Standby . With the camera feature 
Exposure Start Delay  you can determine the period of time between the detection of 
the trigger signal and the actual start of the exposure. 
Furthermore, the power consumption of all ace 2 cameras has been reduced. 
 
Features for selected models 
By activating the  Window Cropping Mode on Rolling Shutter Sensors IMX334 and 
IMX334ROI models the ace 2 camera allows higher framerates when the Region of 
Interest has been reduced. 
For all ace 2 Pro USB models it is now possible to read out the selected Power 
Source. 
We also included some maintenance work and fixed bugs. PRODUCT CHANGE NOTIFICATION

 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
The CoaXPress Premium Cables are subject of a mechanical design change. Reason 
are improvements of the longterm Basler supply chain from manufacturer to our 
customers with the focus on quality , stability and supply reliability . 
The compatibility of the cables with our CoaXPress cameras remain s the same.  
 
Change Description  
The main changes are:  
- the connector changes   
- the raw cable becomes thinner . Due to this, the minimum bending radius of the 
new cable design improves significantly.  
Currently, only the 3m and 5m version receive a design change. Longterm, also the 
10m Basler Premium CoaXPress Cable ( 2200000321 ) is expected to switch to  the 
new design. This will be published in a separate PCN.

Title:  New material codes for dart BCON for 
LVDS models / Development Kits  
Product Family:  dart BCON for LVDS, Development Kits

Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:

 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
 
Basler ’s embedded port folio exists  of camera modules and accompanying 
development kits. Up to  date the development kits have fallen under the product 
category  PowerPack s. In preparation for future portfolio extension s a new pr oduct 
category “Development Kits ” has now been created . As a consequence, the product 
type of the current development kits has changed accordingly.  
The dart BCON for LVDS is Basler’s first camera module with a low -level embedded 
interfac e. BCON is Basler’s proprietary interface technology for embedded systems. In 
preparation for future portfolio extensions based on BCON technology the material 
codes for all dart BCON for LVDS models have changed.  
 
Change Description  
 
In Basler’s material  codes the second last letter describes which interface the camera 
or camera module provides.   
Example:  daA1280 -54bm  
For all dart BCON for LVDS models this letter has now changed from b (BCON)  to l 
(LVDS).   
Example:  daA1280 -54lm  
Please find below a list of all dart BCON for LVDS models with new material codes.

CUSTOMER STORYAOI System with Frame Grabbers and FPGA 
Applet from Silicon Software 
Delvitech from Switzerland offers automatic optical inspection (AOI) to prevent process errors, increase the yield 
and reduce the costs in the manufacturing of assembled printed circuit boards (PCB). The core element of these 
systems is an optical head consisting of five cameras and various side-mounted illuminations. The company recently 
developed a new head upgrade for its AOI systems installed in the market, with more powerful cameras and frame 
grabbers – and is now benefiting of important sales, offering solutions significantly better with higher speed, 
improved detectability and greater flexibility. 
Delvitech needed new cameras for the optical head, as 
the existing ones lagged behind the desired high image 
quality. The cameras had to achieve a higher resolution, 
have suitable interfaces to the new frame grabbers and 
acquire at least 30 frames per second. For the scalability 
of the system, the interchangeability of cameras and 
frame grabbers was an important requirement, indepen -
dent of the camera interface and without changing the 
image processing software developed in-house. 
In the optical head there are a camera at the top and four 
cameras at the side together with 24 xenon light sources, 
4 RGB leds and a special sensor. A monochrome CMOS 
area scan camera 25 Mpixel with CoaXPress interface 
was selected for the upper camera instead of the pre -
vious 4 MP resolution camera. Four monochrome Camera 
Link Basler ace CMOS with 4 MP resolution and 180 
frames per second are now used for the side cameras 
replacing the previous analog ones. The upper camera 
has a larger sensor so that fine features can be better 
resolved or the same level of performance can be main -
tained at a higher throughput. Due to the also larger 
sensors of the side cameras, discrepancies in the resolu -
tion between all cameras are reduced. The selected 
cameras are dimensioned to run below their potential 
performance and therefore allow the performance of the 
system to be enhanced at a later stage. Scalability and Great Flexibility 
The disadvantage of the frame grabbers used so far was 
that they were only suitable for special cameras and were 
incompatible with the new high performance cameras 
selected, the intended light sources and the self-deve -
loped software based on algorithms with artificial intelli -
gence. Therefore Delvitech chose two different program -
mable frame grabbers from Silicon Software, both com -
patible with diverse cameras and lighting as well as the 
software. The upper camera, four side cameras and the 
lighting are synchronized by the microEnable 5 VCX-QP 
CoaXPress frame grabber, while the up to four side 
cameras are triggered by two Camera Link frame grab -
bers microEnable 5 VCL. With the system upgrade, Del -
vitech also switched to the very powerful 64bit D.ONE 
Core. 
The system was designed for scalability with the use of 
one standard camera up to five high-end cameras in the 
highest expansion stage, which the frame grabbers 
support. In order to connect them to the software, the 
project partners jointly developed image acquisition 
functions as a hardware applet using the FPGA develop -
ment environment VisualApplets from Silicon Software 
with the advantage that the frame grabbers, already 
during the image transfer, always generate the same 
output format. This means that the software can be easily 
further used when changing cameras, frame grabbers or 
the camera interface. The applet was designed as a data 
flow model and synthesized as FPGA code for the runtime 
environment on the frame grabber. The overall imple -
mentation of hardware, software and applet was com -
pleted within a few days. “We owe the short development 
time to Silicon Software‘s extraordinary consulting com -
petence and operational readiness. On the basis of only 
two coaching sessions the design-in could be completed 
entirely,” explains Roberto Gatti, VP Sales and Marketing 
of Delvitech.

High-Quality Software Included 
When inspecting assembled printed circuit boards, the 
AOI system on the one hand checks the presence, 
absence, the polarity, the names, the colors, the polari -
ties, and the correct positioning of the components. On 
the other hand, it inspects the shape of the solder joints 
by their form detecting opens, shorts, cold solder joints 
and any type of defects related to wrong solder joints on 
reflow and wave applications. For this purpose, a part of 
the printed circuit board is illuminated according to the 
specifications of the software using RGB led, whereupon 
one or more cameras trigger and take images with color 
reflection. This creates one or more images from different 
angles, whose colors are later reconstructed using the 
Delvitech software. The frame grabbers synchronize the 
triggering of the cameras and the numerous light sources 
via a flash controller. After image acquisition, the images 
are corrected by the software in the course of image pre -
processing, for example their orientation. The AOI image processing system with the optical head is 
used in production plants. Due to the now given higher 
camera resolution, it achieves significantly better measu -
rement results at four times the speed and higher frame 
rate. This means that considerably more examinations of 
printed circuit boards can be carried out per minute – at 
the same cost of the overall system. The system now pro -
cesses images in just half a second, from acquisition and 
image pre-processing to merging and comparing the 
images, analyzing them and outputting the results. “The 
components can be flexibly exchanged and scaled 
regardless of the camera model and interface, and the 
system can be easily adapted to new customer require -
ments thanks to the accompanying applet,” states Gatti. 
In order to meet these requirements in the future, an 
extension of the system to 3D inspection with stereo 
vision is planned, which would further optimize the 
system.

PCN Number :  09/2021  
Title:  Temperature State Feature – 
Removed on certain ace U and ace 
L cameras (part 3)  
Product Family:  ace U and  ace L  with certain sensors  
Release date:  September  06, 2021 
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
The demand -supply -situation for semiconductor -related components has become 
increasingly tense  and it  is our utmost aim to provide our customers  with the most 
reliable and competitive lead times possible in this challenging environment .  
One component that faces a s hortage is a temperatu re sensor that is needed for the 
“Device Temperature  Feature ” and the “Temperature State Feature ”.  
Due to the shortage of the temperature sensor we will focus on delivering cameras 
and reduce the  feature scope . The “Device Temperature F eature ” won’t be of  use 
anymore and the “Temperature State Feature ” will be deactivated for the cameras 
listed below.   
We manage to stay within the UL certifications, but this means the cameras may only 
be operate d with a lens  or any other heat dissipating device . 
Once the demand -supply -situation  has relaxed, we plan to offer both feature s again. 
This will be published in another Product Change Notification.  
 
Affected cameras  (detailed list of models below):  
ace U GigE with the following sensors: Python 2000, Python 5000, IMX174, IMX249, 
IMX273, IMX287, IMX264, ICX618 Replacement  
 
ace U and ace L USB with the following sensors: Python 500, Python 1300, Python 
2000, Python 5000, IMX174, IMX249, IMX250, IMX252, IMX183, IMX304, IMX253, 
IMX267, IMX255, IMX264 color, IMX265 colo r, IMX273 color

Change Description  
 
The following Temperature R equirements  are specified in our Basler Product 
Documentation to operate the cameras listed below.  
Housing Temperature during operation  0-50 °C  
Housing Temperature according to UL  max. 70°C  
Ambient Temperature according to UL  max. 30°C  
UL test conditions : no lens attached to camera; no heat dissipation measures; 
ambient temperature kept at 30°C.  
 
The temperature limits will not change. However, to stay in accordance with UL  the 
test conditions were changed: cameras need to always be equipped with a lens . No 
camera exceeds the UL temperature limit of 70°C and all cameras will keep their UL 
certification.  
Please note that t o avoid burns or damaging the camera you must never use the 
camera without a lens  or alternative heat dissipation  to operate  the camera  
according to the specified maximum housing temperature of 50°C .  
 
 
The Device Temperature  camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the camera  (see Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below , the feature will still be accessible. However, 
because the se cameras will not be equipped with the temperature sensor, a  default  
value of 421°C  will be returned .

The Temperature State  camera feature indicates whether the camera's internal 
temperature is normal or too high.  In case of over temperature , the image acquisition 
is stopped and a  test image appears until the camera has cooled down again  (see 
Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below, the feature will be deactiva ted by removing the 
temperature thresholds. It will always return the parameter value “ok”.   
 
The over temperature threshold is for the following two purposes:  
1) Ensuring UL conformity of the camera .  
This requirement is still fulfilled as described  above.   
 
2) Preventing damage of the camera.   
At elevated temperatures, the camera may get damaged, the camera's lifetime is 
shortened, and image quality can degrade.  We therefore ask you to take special care 
to provide sufficient heat dissipation to maintain the temperat ure of the camera 
housing at 50 °C or less .  
 
If sufficient heat dissipation is provided in the application and cameras are operated 
according to the specified maximum housing temperature of 50°C , this product 
change does not have an impact on heat development within the camera.  
In case cameras in your application have switched to test images before (please see 
“Temperature State Feature” ), your application might exceed the specified operating 
temperature  and additional measures to provide sufficient heat dissipation might be 
needed. Please contact our Basle r Support team for assistance.  
If cameras in your  application haven’t switched  to test images before, the removed 
thresholds will have no  consequence.  
 
Please note that  you won’t be able to update future firmware versions on cameras that 
were produced  without the temperature sensor.

Title: Simplified licensing model of 
VisualApplets  
Product Family: VisualApplets 
Release date:  November 1st, 2022  
Contact:     Basler Support  
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous     Firmware     PC Software 
 Product design   Process  
 
Reason for Change 
 
To enhance VisualApplets for Basler customers, the VisualApplets licensing model will 
be simplified starting with VisualApplets version 3.3.2.  
 
Change Description 
 
Starting from November 1st 2022, all licenses for previous VisualApplets extensions, 
e.g., VisualApplets 3 Expert License, VisualApplets 3 Debugging License, 
VisualApplets 3 Parameters Translation License, VA3 LIB JPEG Compression 
License, VA3 LIB Segment./Classification License, will be discontinued.  
Instead, these licenses will be automatically included into the VisualApplets IDE 
License. 
The same change also affects all corresponding VisualApplets test licenses, which will 
be included into the VisualApplets IDE (Eval.) License. 
The changes will be effective with VisualApplets version 3.3.2 and will apply to all 
upcoming VisualApplets versions.

Title:  Device Temperature Feature – 
Removed on certain ace U and ace 
L cameras  
Product Family:  ace U and  ace L  with certain sensors  
Release date:  August 16, 2021 
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
The demand -supply -situation for semiconductor -related components has become 
increasingly tense  and it  is our utmost aim to provide our customers  with the most 
reliable and competitive lead times possible in this challenging environment .  
One component that faces a s hortage is a temperature sensor that is needed for the 
Device Temperature camera feature . This feature has never been officially supported 
and listed in our Basler Product Documentation for the cameras listed below. 
However, for the convenience of our customers it was available anyway.     
Due to the shortage of the temperature sensor we will focus on delivering cameras 
and go back to the officially stated feature scope . The Device Temperature camera 
feature won’t be of use  anymore for the cameras listed below.   
Once the demand -supply -situation has relaxed, we plan to offer the feature again. 
This will be published in another Product Change Notification.  
 
Affected cameras (detailed  list of models below):   
 ace L GigE  (IMX267, IMX304)  
 ace U USB (IMX226, IMX178)  
 ace U GigE (IMX226, IMX178)

Change Description  
 
The Device Temperature  camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the camera  (see Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below , the feature will still be accessible. However, 
because the se cameras will not be equipped with the temperature sensor, a  default  
value of 421°C  will be returned .   
 
The related  Temperature State  camera feature indicates whether the camera's 
internal temperature is normal or too high.  In case of over temperature , the image 
acquisition is stopped and a  test image appears until the camera has cooled down 
again.  
As stated in our Basler Product Documentation , the feature has never been supported 
by these cameras.  Nevertheless in pylon Viewer the feature has always shown the 
parameter value  “ok”, this will not change . 
   
This change does not have any impact on heat development within the cameras.

Title:  Firmware  Update For ace 2 
Cameras  
Product Family:  ace 2  
Release date:  June  17, 2020 (PM)  
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
There are two main reasons for this new firmware release:  
1. We fixed a b ug in our ace 2 models which mainly limited the possible speed 
increase for our Compression Beyond feature on ace 2 GigE cameras.  
2. We added a new High Speed Burst Mode, allowing the user to trigger a 
predefined burst of images at the maximum sensor speed possible in our 
hardware.  
 
Change Description  
1. Fixed Bug  
The fixed behavior of our camera now allows the user to achieve a factor two increase 
in speed on ace 2 Pro GigE cameras by using the Compression Beyond feature. The 
accurate increase heavily depends on the working point of the camera (pixel form at, 
ROI, etc.).  
2. New High Speed Burst Mode  
Usually, the frame rate of the camera is not only limited by its sensor and internal 
buffer, but also by its ability to transfer data. This includes, e.g., the interface 
bandwidth or your network setup.  
The High Speed burst mode allows you to work around these data transfer limitations 
and acquire a burst of images as quickly as possible.  PRODUCT CHANGE NOTIFICATION

To achieve this, during a burst, acquiring images and filling the camera's internal 
buffer is highly prioritized over transmitt ing data. Usually, images will be transmitted 
only after all images of a burst have been acquired. This may introduce a delay after 
each burst, i.e., lower the burst rate.

documentation .

Change Description  
Sequencer  
The Sequencer  camera feature  allows you to define sets of parameter settings, called 
sequencer sets, and apply them to a sequence of image acquisitions.  
As the camera acquires images, it applies one sequencer set after the other. This 
enables you to quickly change camera parameters without compromising the 
maximum frame rate.  
For further information about  this feature  please take a look at our product 
documentation  or contact the Basler Support.  
 
Static Defect Pixel Correction  
The Defect Pixel Correction  camera feature  allows you to minimize the influence of 
sensitivity differences of individual pixels of the sensor.  
In acquired images, some pixels may appear significantly brighter or darker than the 
rest, even if uniform light is used. This problem is caused by differences in sensitivity 
of the individual pixels which in turn are due to production tolerances.  
The Static Defect Pixel Correction is based on files that are stored on the camera and 
contain a list of defect pixel coordinates.  
The following defect pixel correction files can be stored on the camera:  
• Factory file: Contains the coordinates of defect pixels that were detected during 
camera production. With this file, the camera corrects pixels that have a 
significantly  lower  intensity value than the neighboring pixels, including 
completely black pixels.  
• User fil e: Contains user -defined coordinates. You can upload this file to the 
camera. This allows you to define new defect pixels that might have occurred  
over time, regardless of whether these pixels are too dark or too bright.  
For further information about this  feature  please take a look at our product 
documentation  or contact the Basler Support.

CUSTOMER STORYMulti-talented: Basler boost with Customized 
Interface Card in a Line Scan Application
Customer
 MJV-Sähkö Oy and Lateral Engine Oy
 Location:  Lahti, Finland and Espoo, Finland
 Industry: Factory Automation
 Implementation: 2019-2020
Application
MJV-Sähkö Oy delivers machine vision systems with 
parameterization capability for the sorting of plywood 
sheets for the plywood industry. In their automation pro -
jects such as veneer grading it is important to work with 
efficient, up-to-date automation systems to achieve high 
productivity. The veneer grading process often uses line 
scan cameras that require a complex installation process. 
This is why MJV-Sähkö Oy was looking for a color area 
scan camera that not only fulfils the requirements for the 
inspection process of the veneer grading, but can also be 
installed easily.Solution and Benefits
In the veneer sheet grading application, the sheets (e.g. 
1800 mm wide) are imaged on a conveyor using high-
resolution line scan imaging. Software analyzes the 
sheets using modern deep-learning techniques and the 
results can be used by the manufacturing system for 
various purposes such as separating the sheets into diffe -
rent grades or splicing the material.
“There is nothing revolutionary in line scan applications 
but the novelty at the core of this Customer Story is how 
we communicated with Basler to implement a Basler area 
scan camera for the imaging”, states Jaakko Rantala from 
Lateral Engine Oy. The basic idea is to configure the 
camera and the interface card so that the camera uses an 
AOI of only a few lines at a very high frame rate (e.g. 4 
lines @ 2000 Hz, triggered by an encoder interface). The 
chunks of grouped lines are then efficiently stitched 
together on the interface card side before transferring 
the complete frames to the host software.
This was made possible by following:
 High-resolution CMOS sensor of the Basler boost 
camera
 High bandwidth achieved by the CoaXPress 2.0 
interface (Basler boost camera + Basler CXP-12 
interface card)
 Most importantly: the excellent collaboration with 
Basler in which the interface card was upgraded to 
support new features. The features consist of the line 
stitching and an encoder interface for camera 
triggering.

Title:  Temperature State Feature – 
Removed on certain ace U and ace 
L cameras  
Product Family:  ace U and  ace L  with certain sensors  
Release date:  August 23, 2021 
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
The demand -supply -situation for semiconductor -related components has become 
increasingly tense  and it  is our utmost aim to provide our customers  with the most 
reliable and competitive lead times possible in this challenging environment .  
One component that faces a s hortage is a temperature sensor that is needed for the 
“Device Temperature  Feature ” and the “Temperature State Feature ”.  
Due to the shortage of the temperature sensor we will focus on delivering cameras 
and reduce the  feature scope . The “Device Temperature F eature ” won’t be of use  
anymore and the “Temperature State Feature ” will be deactivated for the cameras 
listed below.   
Once the demand -supply -situation  has relaxed, we plan to offer both feature s again. 
This will be published in another Product Change Notification.  
 
Affected cameras  (detailed list of models below):  
 
 ace U GigE with IMX183, IMX265, Python  300, Python 500 and Python  1300 
Sensor   
 ace U USB with IMX273 mono, IMX265 mono, IMX264 m ono, IMX287 and 
Python  300 Sensor  
 
Depending on the  stock situation we might expand this measure to further cameras 
models soon.

We share this  initial version of the Product Change Notification by email once and 
publish updates  later on our Website. Therefore please closely monitor th is Product 
Change Notification on our Website . All recent updates are marked in red.  
 
Change Description  
 
The following Temperature R equirements  are specified in our Basler Product 
Documentation to operate the cameras listed below. These Requirements are still 
valid and will not change.  
Housing Temperature during operation  0-50 °C  
Housing Temperature according to UL 60950 -1 max. 70°C  
Ambient Temperature according to UL 60950 -1 max. 30°C  
UL 60950 -1 test conditions: no lens attached to camera; no heat dissipation 
measures; ambient temperature kept at 30°C.  
 
The Device Temperature  camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the camera  (see Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below , the feature will  still be accessible. However, 
because the se cameras will not be equipped with the temperature sensor, a  default  
value of 421°C  will be returned .   
 
The Temperature State  camera feature indicates whether the camera's internal 
temperature is normal or too high.  In case of over temperature , the image acquisition 
is stopped and a  test image appears until the camera has cooled down again  (see 
Basler Product Documentation ).  
For the camera models listed below, the feature will be deactivated by removing the 
temperature thresholds. It will always return the parameter value “ok”.

The over temperature threshold used to serve two purposes:  
1) Ensuring UL conformity of the camera .  
This requirement is still fulfilled. The threshold is only removed from models that do 
not exceed the maximum 70°C Housing Temperature according to UL 60950 -1.  
 
2) Preventing damage of the camera.   
At elevated temperatures, the camera may get damaged, the camera's lifetime is 
shortened, and image quality can degrade.  We therefore ask you to take special care 
to provide sufficient heat dissipation to maintain the temperat ure of the camera 
housing at 50 °C or less .  
 
If sufficient heat dissipation is provided in the application and cameras are operated 
according to the specified maximum housing temperature of 50°C , this product 
change does not have an impact on heat development within the camera.  
In case cameras in your application have switched to test images before (please see 
“Temperature State Feature” ), your application might exceed the specified operating 
temperature  and additional measures to provide sufficient heat dissipation might be 
needed. Please contact our Basle r Support team for assistance.  
If cameras in your  application haven’t switched  to test images before, the removed 
thresholds will have no  consequence.  
 
Please note that  you won’t be able to update future firmware versions on cameras that 
were produced  without the temperature sensor.

 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
Due to persistent  problems in logistics, inventory management and release 
management caused by single dart orders associated  with loans  and general design 
sample  as well as  custom dart prototype distribution all dart models (dar t USB, dart 
BCON for LVDS) are  now shipped  in single packaged units.  
 
Change Description  
To date , the dart USB as well as the dart BCON for LVDS camera modules have been  
shipped in package units of 5 cameras. Also, the minimum order  quantity for all dart 
models has been  5 pieces . Starting from January 15th 2018   this will change and all 
dart models (dart USB, dart BCON for LVDS) will be shipped to customers in single 
packaged units . In a ddition to that the MOQ is reduced to 1 piece for all models.  
The changeover to individual packaging has no effect on the current list prices of the 
dart family (dart USB, dart BCON for LVDS). Also, w ith changing the  minimum order 
quantity, all customers are no longer obliged to order a multiple of 5 dart cameras.

Type of Change:

To provide our customers the best possible images, we always think of new features

Change Description 
Vignetting is a well-known phenomenon in image proc essing and describes the 
decrease in image brightness towards the edge. This  often results in this effect: 
           
Fig. 1 Left without Vignetting Correction Feature, R ight with Vignetting Correction Feature 
Our Vignetting Correction feature corrects this eff ect and at the same time there is no 
negative effect on the frame rate or image quality after a one-time calibration of the 
camera, since the correction values are stored in t he camera and automatically taken 
into account in the image output. 
Please note that you have to use pylon 5.2.0 or hig her to use the Vignetting Feature. 
Further details about the feature behavior and the usage can be found on:

 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
We continuously optimize our products and processes. For this reason we decide d to 
optimize our Getting Started Guide.  The Getting Started Guide is a letter where we 
explain  how to get started with a camera . Until today it is  enclosed in every box within  
which  the camera is delivered.   
This change will lead to a better quality of information for our customers by using our 
online product documentation.  Furthermore, we avoid the usage of  unnecessary paper  
which is often discarded . This takes us one step closer to less paper consumption in 
terms of sustainability . 
Change Description  
 
The Getting Started Guide which is enclosed within the box  of each camera  will be 
exchanged by  an universal  product inlay card.

Change Description 
With revision 106202 – 17  the model acA1300-60gmNIR gets a new firmware vers ion.  
 
Reason for Change 
The firmware change was necessary to adapt the sens or behavior especially the 
saturation capacity due to production variation of the sensor manufacturer, but we 
make sure that it is within our camera test specifi cation.  
Due to production variation of the sensor manufactu rer – especially at the production 
of the silicon for sensors – it could came to minim al deviation of sensor behavior. This 
could appear at lower saturation capacity or bloomi ng effect at long exposure times 
and high gain on the other hand. 
Basler optimize this sensor behavior with the new f irmware to deliver the familiar 
quality at its best.

Title:  Basler SLP Controller now up to  
100ms pulse width  
Product Family:  Basler Lighting

Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
To provide our customers the best poss ible images, we continuously listen to the 
feedback of our customers  to improve their machines and applications.  
In particular, customers who use rolling shutter sensors and are already enthusiastic 
about the Basler SLP feature have asked for a longer pulse width of the SLP controlle r. 
Therefore, the Basler SLP Controller will now support a pulse width of 50µs up to 
100ms.  
We are very pleased that the new Basler SLP feature , which drives down the effort to 
integrate lightings in a vision system strongly , has been so well received from our 
customers.  
Further information about this feature can be found on:  
https://www.baslerweb.com/en/products/vision -components/basler -lighting/  
 
Change Description  
Basler SLP is an easy way to add lighting to a vision system.  
The Basler SLP camera feature enables the Basler SLP controller  to be used together 
with the all our popular ace U and ace L cameras . PRODUCT CHANGE NOTIFICATION

The feature enables the direct communication between the Basler SLP Controller and 
the camera, allowing the lighting to be easily operated in different modes such as 
continuous, strobe or overdrive.  
When using the Basler SLP Controller, the user can also b enefit from the compatibility 
with the Basler SLP feature and gain access to the simple lighting concept vi a a uniform 
software interface - Basler pylon Camera Software Suite . 
In addition users are given the freedom to choose from a variety of standard lig ht 
sources or use their own.  The solution is suitable for users with lighting experience who 
have applications with specific lighting requirements.  
Based on customer feedback, we have now extended the pulse width . Before this 
change a pulse width of  50µs up to 5 ms. Now each newly ordered Basler SLP Controller 
will support a pulse width of 50µs up to 100ms .  
We are happy that the Basler SLP Controller is now also the right choice for applications 
that require a longer pulse width.

Title:  Firmware Update on         
acA640 -121gm  
Product Family:  ace U 
Release date:  29.04. 2019  
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
To provide our customers the best possible  replacement camera for the discontinued 
CCD sensor ICX618 , Basler  developed and just recently launched  the acA640 -121gm .  
In some cases users experience d long times for opening the camera. This long 
opening times are caused by the poor performance of olde r GenICam versions in 
caching the more complex GenICam XML Files in current cameras.  
In order to resolve that issue a more recent GenICam version or a new camera 
firmware is required.   
With this firmware release the acA640 -121gm comes along with two different XML 
Files in order to allow the best performance in both cases.  
 
Further information about  Baslers unique 1:1 replacement camera  acA640 -121 can be 
found on:  
https://www.baslerweb.com/en/products/product -highlights/icx618 -replacement/

Change Description  
With this firmware release of FW1.1 -0 the acA640 -121gm comes along with two 
different XML Files.  
Due to the explained intended use as a replacement camera  for older camera models , 
the XML File for an improved behavior with older SDK/GenICam versions is set by 
default.  
If customers want to use the fully equipped feature set (e.g. including USEM, 
Sequencer, PGI, etc.) and are using a new SDK/GenICam version, it is possible to 
switch the XML file.

C23 5MP 16mm and 35mm 
lenses 
Product Family:  Basler Premium Lenses

Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:

 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
We optimized the mechanical design of the C23 5MP lens series to improve the 
adjustability and overall accuracy of the aperture. Due to this optimization the min F -
number  of the C23 5MP 16mm and 35mm lenses had to be changed.  
 
Change Description  
The minimum F-number ha d to be changed from f/1.8 to f/ 2.0. This was necessary 
due to overlapping tolerances. This should not be noticed in most applications and we 
don’t expect any impact on your system.  
Please note that the n aming has  change d too (see list below).

Title:  IR-Cut Filter  change  on  
dedicated  ace U cameras  
Product Family:  ace U

Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
Due to ong oing optimizations and process  improvements we changed the IR cut f ilter 
and der f ilter holder (also know n as “passepartout ”) for dedicated  ace U models.  
Change Description  
 
Effected models:  
- ace U with Python  300, Python  500 and Python1300 Sensors 
- ace U with IMX252 and IMX265 Sensors  
Please see detailed list with a ffected camera models below.  
The following pictures show a n IMX265 Sensor, where the difference is visible. The 
passepartout appears  a little bit smaller than the old one  and reduces diffused light. 
The specification  of the IR- Cut filter and their transmission did not change.

 Alitheon, Inc. 
 Location: Bellevue, Washington, USA
 Industry: Factory Automation / Industrial Software
 Implementation: 2020
Application
Each year, global manufacturers and their suppliers 
deliver increasingly sophisticated products to their  
customers. Advanced vehicles, electronics, and other 
engineered goods now reach their markets through a 
precise physical and digital orchestration, with every 
component playing a role for quality and performance. 
Products such as, fasteners, circuit boards, castings, and 
even textiles must now be “smart” – uniquely identified 
and individually traceable. Yet these high-volume parts 
often resist identification, their design incompatible with 
barcode labels, etchings, or packaging. Alitheon was 
founded to solve this problem with a universal traceabi -
lity model, providing item-level certainty without altering 
product designs or manufacturing processes. With just a 
camera in the factory or in the field, Alitheon technology 
verifies the identity of virtually any object using software 
algorithms.
Through contactless machine vision, Alitheon software 
analyses the surface of every unique product or part, 
generating a digital code that differentiates it from even 
millions of seemingly identical objects. This FeaturePrint™ 
ID represents an authoritative, virtual serial number that 
can be stored, checked, and rechecked over an object’s 
entire useful life. In factory settings, FeaturePrint soft -
ware retrofits existing production lines through conti -
nuous-duty industrial cameras. With automated optics 
and sensors in place, even decades-old factory sites can 
easily receive an all-new digital control system to track 
goods. FeaturePrint endpoints can be attached to 
machine cells or operator stations, verifying the  
production flow, and generating data for the enterprise. 
Once a FeaturePrint ID is captured, it is available via cloud 
systems to allow goods to be verified anywhere – in 
plants, distribution channels, or with end users using a mobile app. In order to allow clear identification, Alitheon 
searched for a camera with the ability to capture even the 
smallest details and often during fast moving production 
lines.
Solution and Benefits 
Alitheon specifies Basler products through its Feature -
Print Automate and Feature Print Station components. 
Deployed within a machine retrofit chassis or a benchtop 
form factor, Basler ace L and Classic cameras generate 
images that keep up with production lines. In an automo -
tive setting, a powertrain part may transform through 
automated stages including raw stock, machining, heat 
treating, and grinding. In this case, a Basler camera ope -
rates at each of these four steps, triggering Alitheon’s 
FeaturePrint processing and ensuring continuous quality 
control. Or, in a contract electronics manufacturing 
scenario, a team of skilled operators may utilize multiple 
camera stations powered by Basler cameras and Alitheon 
technology to guide the correct assembly of circuit 
boards and modules. Later, in field service or aftermarket 
settings, the FeaturePrint ID originally generated onsite is 
available for product verification within a mobile app.

Reason for Change  
Due to the fact that our standa rd cables did not fit with our  previous  Basler GigE 
Interface C ard, 4 port, a new card was added to the portfolio instead.  The ports of the 
old card were too close together, which is why the cables did not fit.

Title:  SLP Feature for  
several ace models  
Product Family:  ace U / ace  L 
Release date:  14 August, 2019  
Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
To provide our customers the best poss ible images, we always think about new 
features that help customers to improve their machines and applications.  
The most recent feature of this extension is Basler SLP, which drives down  the effort 
to integrate lightings in a vision system strongly.  
Further information about this feature can be found on:  
https://www.baslerweb.com/en/products/vision -components/basler -lighting/  
 
Change Description  
Basler SLP is an easy way to add lighting to a vision system.  
This first Basler SLP release enables the Basler SLP controller  to be used together 
with the supported camera models listed below.  
The feature enables the direct communication between the Basler SLP Controller and

Title:  Device Temperature Feature 
available again  on ace U and

Product Family:  ace U, ace L  
Release date:  February  22, 2022

 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
 
Due to  the tense  demand -supply -situation we decided to remove  a temperature 
sensor which faced a shortage from our ace U and ace L cameras  in Q3/2021 . We 
focused on delivering cameras and reduced the feature scope.  
The Device Temperature Feature  was of no use and the Temperature State 
Feature  was deactivated.  
 
For further information please  see the published PCN’s from our website:   
Device Temperature Feature removed Part 1  
Device Temperature Feature removed Part 2  
Device Temperature Feature removed Part 3  
 
Now the temperature sensor is available again and we  change all cameras listed 
in the above mentioned PCNs back  to the original feature scope.

The Device Temperature camera feature allows you to determine the camera 
temperature within the cameras (see Basler Product Documentation ). The feature will 
return a correct value agai n and no longer the default value of 421°C.  
 
The Temperature State  camera feature  (see Basler Product Documentation ) 
indicates whether the cameras internal temperature is normal or too high.  In case of 
over temperature, the image acquisition is stopped and a test image appears until the 
camera has cooled down again.  This feature will be activated again and work as 
before .   
Firmware updates are not possible for cameras which were  produced without 
temperature sensor. With this product change a firmware update to future firmware 
versions will be possible again.

Title:  Barcode Change on Product 
Packages  
Product Family:  Basler cameras

Contact:     Basler Support   
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous      Firmware      PC Software  
 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
We as Basler see the traceability of our cameras as very important and equip our 
cameras  with a serial number on the camera itself and on the product outer package.  
The label on the camera outer  package lists the serial number in a barcode which is 
design ed and used especially for internal automated processes. Due to important 
internal system adaptions Basler needs to change the conte nt of the serial number 
barcode  shortly.  The following example shows a product package label with the 
affected barcode marke d red:  
  
We as Basler know about the importance of such an information and can imagine  that 
you as our customer process this information inside  your system as well.  Therefore, 
we would like to inform you herewith about this change and advise you to familiarize 
your scanning system with the new content . The change will take place s hort term 
beginning calendar week  3 in January 2023.

Title: New Firmware Features on ace 2

Release date:  February 2022  
Contact:     Basler Support 
Type of Change:   
 Miscellaneous     Firmware     PC Software 
 Product design   Process  
 
Reason for Change 
To offer an even higher value to our customers, new features were added to the ace 2 
firmware and power consumption has been reduced. Furthermore, the new firmware 
delivers maintenance work and corrects deviating camera behaviors. 
 
Change Description 
 
Basler has added valuable features to the ace 2 family which are available on all 
interfaces. 
For your convenience, the Device Link Speed  as well as the Effective Exposure 
Time might now be read out. Additionally, the Sensor State  of the camera can be 
configurated by choosing the values On, Off or Standby . With the camera feature 
Exposure Start Delay  you can determine the period of time between the detection of 
the trigger signal and the actual start of the exposure. 
Furthermore, the power consumption of all ace 2 cameras has been reduced. 
 
Features for selected models 
By activating the  Window Cropping Mode on Rolling Shutter Sensors IMX334 and 
IMX334ROI models the ace 2 camera allows higher framerates when the Region of 
Interest has been reduced. 
For all ace 2 Pro USB models it is now possible to read out the selected Power 
Source. 
We also included some maintenance work and fixed bugs. PRODUCT CHANGE NOTIFICATION

 Product design    Process 
 
Reason for Change  
The CoaXPress Premium Cables are subject of a mechanical design change. Reason 
are improvements of the longterm Basler supply chain from manufacturer to our 
customers with the focus on quality , stability and supply reliability . 
The compatibility of the cables with our CoaXPress cameras remain s the same.  
 
Change Description  
The main changes are:  
- the connector changes   
- the raw cable becomes thinner . Due to this, the minimum bending radius of the 
new cable design improves significantly.  
Currently, only the 3m and 5m version receive a design change. Longterm, also the 
10m Basler Premium CoaXPress Cable ( 2200000321 ) is expected to switch to  the 
new design. This will be published in a separate PCN.

Reason for Change  
 
Basler ’s embedded port folio exists  of camera modules and accompanying 
development kits. Up to  date the development kits have fallen under the product 
category  PowerPack s. In preparation for future portfolio extension s a new pr oduct 
category “Development Kits ” has now been created . As a consequence, the product 
type of the current development kits has changed accordingly.  
The dart BCON for LVDS is Basler’s first camera module with a low -level embedded 
interfac e. BCON is Basler’s proprietary interface technology for embedded systems. In 
preparation for future portfolio extensions based on BCON technology the material 
codes for all dart BCON for LVDS models have changed.  
 
Change Description  
 
In Basler’s material  codes the second last letter describes which interface the camera 
or camera module provides.   
Example:  daA1280 -54bm  
For all dart BCON for LVDS models this letter has now changed from b (BCON)  to l 
(LVDS).   
Example:  daA1280 -54lm  
Please find below a list of all dart BCON for LVDS models with new material codes.
